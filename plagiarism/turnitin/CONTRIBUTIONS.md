PLagiarism Plugin Contributions
------------------------------

We welcome contributions to all elements of the plugin. Since launch we've had a number of users provide us with fixes and enhancements through either pull request or commits linked to from the issues page. If you are interested in contributing enhancements, or would like to solve an issue raised by another user, please feel free to make a pull request against the develop branch.

Some users also contribute code that while not appropriate for every user may help them solve issues where their workflow is different from that of Turnitin. We'll link to them from this page if appropriate. Please note that we have not tested this code so we don't endorse it, we only provide a link to it here as other users feel someone else may find it useful.
