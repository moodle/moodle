<p align="center"><b>Multiple Dialogues</b></p>

<p>This option allows a person to start more than one dialogue with 
    someone else. The default is No, which only allows one (open) 
    dialogue between two people.</p>

<p>Allowing multiple dialogues may result in an abuse of this 
    facility. Some people may be &quot;pestered&quot; by others 
    opening many unwanted dialogues with them.</p>
