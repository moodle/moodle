If you'd like to contribute any corrections or aditions, please
send them do villate@gnu.org.

You can make some local changes to the translation to suit your needs.
For instance, if you think your site will look better if you translate "Course
Categories" as "Licenciaturas", instead of "Grupo de Disciplinas", as used in
the Portuguese language pack, you can make a copy of the whole directory pt (under
"lang" in the directory where you have installed Moodle) with a different
name, for instance, pt_LX (maximum 5 characters). You will then see another
language "pt_LX" among the choices, which you can choose as the preferred language
for your site.
