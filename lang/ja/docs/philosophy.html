<h1>理念</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moodleのデザイン及び開発作業は特定の学習理念に基づいて行われています。恐らく略された表現をご覧になると思いますが、これは「<em>社会解釈的教授法</em>」という考え方です。(何人かの科学者は、既に「無意味なソフトエディケーション」だと思ってマウスに手をかけたところでしょう。しかし、どうか読み進めてください。この考え方はあらゆる研究領域にとって有益なものですから!)</p>
  <p>このページでは、簡単な用語を使用して、その背後に横たわる<strong>4つの主要な概念</strong>を紐解いて行くことにします。膨大な量の様々な研究における一つの視点を要約する形で説明を行いますので、これらの概念に関して事前に読まれた方にとっては、内容が希薄であると思われます。</p>
  <p>これらの概念があなたにとって全く新しいものである場合、最初は理解し辛いものでしょう。私がご提案出来ますことは、自分が何かを学ぼうとしている時の経験を思い浮かべながら内容を注意深く読み進めることです。<br></p>
  <h3>1. 構成主義</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This point of view maintains that people actively <strong>construct</strong> new knowledge as they interact with their environment. </p>
    <p>Everything you read, see, hear, feel, and touch is tested against your prior knowledge and if it is viable within your mental world, may form new knowledge you carry with you. Knowledge is strengthened if you can use it successfully in your wider environment. You  are not just a memory bank passively absorbing information, nor can knowledge be &quot;transmitted&quot; to you just by reading something or listening to someone.</p>
    <p>This is not to say you can't learn anything from reading a web page or watching a lecture, obviously you can, it's just pointing out that there is more interpretation going on than a transfer of information from one brain to another.<br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>2. 構築主義</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Constructionism asserts that learning is particularly effective when constructing something for others to experience. This can be anything from a spoken sentence or an internet posting, to  more complex artifacts like a painting, a house or a software package.</p>
    <p>For example, you might read this page several times and still forget it by tomorrow - but if you were to try and explain these ideas to someone else in your own words, or produce a slideshow that explained these concepts, then I can guarantee you'd have a better understanding that is more integrated into your own ideas. This is why people take notes during lectures, even if they never read the notes again.<br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>3. 社会構成主義</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This extends the above ideas into a social group constructing things for one another, collaboratively creating a small culture of shared artifacts with shared meanings. When one is immersed within a culture like this, one is learning all the time about how to be a part of that culture, on many levels.</p>
    <p>A very simple example is an object like a cup. The object can be used for many things, but its shape does suggest some &quot;knowledge&quot; about carrying liquids. A more complex example is an online course - not only do the &quot;shapes&quot; of the software tools indicate certain things about the way online courses should work, but the activities and texts produced within the group as a whole will help shape how each person behaves within that group.<br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>4. 関連認識と分離認識</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This idea looks deeper into the motivations of individuals within a discussion. <strong>Separate</strong> behaviour is when someone tries to remain 'objective' and 'factual', and tends to defend their own ideas using logic to find holes in their opponent's ideas. <strong>Connected</strong> behaviour is a more empathic approach that accepts subjectivity, trying to listen and ask questions in an effort to understand the other point of view. <strong>Constructed</strong> behaviour is when a person is sensitive to both of these approaches and is able to choose either of them as appropriate to the current situation.</p>
    <p>In general, a healthy amount of connected behaviour within a learning community is a very powerful stimulant for learning, not only bringing people closer together but promoting deeper reflection and re-examination of their existing beliefs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr>
  <p>Once you are thinking about all these issues, it helps you to focus on the experiences that would be best for   learning from the learner's point of view, rather than just publishing and assessing the information you think they need to know. It can also help you realise how each participant in a course can be a teacher as well as a learner. Your job as a 'teacher' can change from being 'the source of knowledge' to being an influencer and role model of  class culture,  connecting with students in a personal way that addresses their own learning needs, and moderating discussions and activities in a way that collectively leads students towards the learning goals of the class.</p>
  <p>Obviously Moodle doesn't force this style of behaviour, but this is what it is best at supporting. In future, as the technical infrastructure of Moodle stabilises, further improvements in pedagogical support will be a major direction for Moodle development.</p>
