<p align="center"><b>Grading a roll.</b></p>

<p>This feature allows a roll to be graded on a linear scale.  The percentage of the total number of hours in a course a student is present for is added as a grade in the gradebook.  Tardies are included in this calculation as well, and are graded based on the "number of tardies per absence" configuration for the module.</p>

<p>This feature does not work very well when automatic attendance is turned on because there is currently no way for a student to be partially present in a course on a given day.  A student is 100% present or 100% absent in terms of automatic attendance logging.</p>
