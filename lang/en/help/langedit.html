<p align="center"><b>Language Editing</b></p>

<p>To edit languages on this page the files need to be writable 
   by the web server process.

<p>Within some of the strings you will notice <b>$a</b> and <b>$a->something</b>.

<p>These represent variables that will be replaced by names or other words from 
   within Moodle.  

<p>When there is only one variable, the $a form is used.  When there are two or 
   more variables, then each one has a name.
