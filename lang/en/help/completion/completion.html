<h1>Completion tracking</h1>

<p>
If this option is turned on, the system will track whether students have 
completed the activity. Activity completion is shown to students beside each 
activity, and can also be viewed (for all their students) by teachers.
</p>

<p>
There are three values for this option:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Off. Completion information is not tracked for this activity.</li>
<li>Manual. Students can tick a box beside the activity to indicate
  that they have completed it.</li>
<li>Automatic. Based on conditions set on this screen (immediately below the
  dropdown), the activity will automatically be marked completed.</li>
</ul> 

<p>
Some types of activity do not support automatic conditions, so you can only 
choose Off or Manual.
