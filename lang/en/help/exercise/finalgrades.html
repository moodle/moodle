<p>The table on this screen lists the overall grades and their breakdown. The first grade is
	the grade for the (inital) assessment. This is added to the grades given to each 
	submission. The Weights row gives the factors used in the calculation of the overall 
	grade from these two grades. The final grade given for this assignment will either be 
	the average of these overall grades or the overall grade of the best submission.

<p>The League table lists each student's best submission. The table is in grade order with 
	the best submission first.</p>
