<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Defining the main glossary of the course</B></P>

<P>The glossary system allows you to export entries from any secondary glossary to the main one of the course.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you should specify which glossary is the main one.</p>

<p>Note: You can only have one main glossary per course and only teachers are allowed to update it.</p>
