<H2>Features</H2>
<p>Moodle is an active and evolving product. This page lists some of the many 
  features it contains:</p>
<p><strong>Overall design</strong></p>
<UL>
  <LI>Promotes a social constructionist pedagogy (collaboration, activities, critical 
    reflection, etc)</LI>
  <LI>Suitable for 100% online classes as well as supplementing face-to-face learning 
  <LI>Simple, lightweight, efficient, compatible, low-tech browser interface</LI>
  <LI>Easy to install on almost any platform that supports PHP. Requires only 
    one database.</LI>
  <LI>Full database abstraction supports all major brands of database (except 
    for initial table definition)</LI>
  <LI>Course listing shows descriptions for every course on the server, including 
    accessibility to guests.</LI>
  <LI>Emphasis on strong security throughout. Forms are all checked, data validated, 
    cookies encrypted etc</LI>
</UL>
<p><strong>Site management</strong></p>
<UL>
  <LI>Site is managed by an admin user, defined during setup</LI>
  <LI>Plug-in "themes" allow the admin to customise the site colours, fonts, layout 
    etc to suit local needs</LI>
  <LI>Plug-in activity modules can be added to existing Moodle installations</LI>
  <LI>Plug-in language packs allow full localisation to any language. These can 
    be edited using a built-in web-based editor.  Currently there are language packs
    for more than <A HREF="http://moodle.com/download/lang/" TARGET="_top">19 languages</A>.</LI>
  <LI>The code is clearly-written PHP under a GPL license - easy to modify to 
    suit your needs</LI>
</UL>
<p><strong>User management</strong></p>
<UL>
  <LI>Goals are to reduce admin involvement to a minimum, while retaining high 
    security</LI>
  <LI>Supports a range of authentication mechanisms through plug-in authentication 
    modules, allowing easy integration with existing systems.</LI>
  <LI>Standard email method: students can create their own login accounts. Email 
    addresses are verified by confirmation.</LI>
  <LI>LDAP method: account logins can be checked against an LDAP server. Admin 
    can specify which fields to use.</LI>
  <LI>IMAP, POP3, NNTP: account logins are checked against a mail or news server. 
    SSL, certificates and TLS are supported.</LI>
  <LI>External database: any database containing at least two fields can be used 
    as an external authentication source.</LI>

    can have different access</LI>
  <LI>An admin account controls the creation of courses and creates teachers by 
    assigning users to courses</LI>
  <LI>Security - teachers can add an "enrolment key" to their courses to keep 
    out non-students. They can give out this key face-to-face or via personal 
    email etc</LI>
  <LI>Teachers can unenrol students manually if desired, otherwise they are automatically 
    unenrolled after a certain period of inactivity (set by the admin)</LI>
  <LI>Students are encouraged to build an online profile including photos, description.
