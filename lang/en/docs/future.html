<H2>Future</H2>
<P>I'm committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open and Free. 
  I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted education and 
  empowered teaching, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to the realisation 
  of these ideals. 

<P>As Moodle gains in maturity, I hope its directions are influenced by the community 
  of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features and their status 
  can be found at <A TARGET=_top HREF="http://bugs.moodle.org/">bugs.moodle.org</A>. 
  Your <A href="developer.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome. 

<P>Until about April 2003, my own involvement will slow down while I finish my PhD thesis.
   During this time there will still be releases, but they will only contain minor 
   new features and bug fixes.  I will also be including modules and other code contributed 
   by others.

<P>After this time, by around June/July 2003, I am expecting a major release called Moodle 2.0
   that will include major new features such as:
   <UL>
   <LI>Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students
   <LI>Support for groups and group work
   <LI>Rewritten display incorporating XML, XSL and CSS for full flexibility 
       and compatibility with all modern web standards.
   <LI>Basic support for IMS and SCORM
   <LI>A variety of new modules (chat, tracker etc)
   <LI>Whatever else seems most important at the time  :-)
   </UL>

<P>About this time I will also be experimenting with ways of making 
   Moodle development more sustainable for the long term.  This may 
   include offering services for payment - although the software itself 
   will always remain Free.
