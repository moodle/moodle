<h1>Future</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target=_top href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> for more details. You can also pay to have certain features developed sooner- see <a href="http://moodle.com/development/" target="_top">moodle.com/development</a> for information and a quote. </p>
  <p>Here is our current vision of the future, though this is always subject to change depending on sponsors and developers. </p>
  <h3>Version 1.4 - August 31st </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This release contains a lot of structural improvements and refactoring in key modules. It also includes many interface improvements. Some highlights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New <strong>Enrolments</strong> architecture allows all manner of new automated enrolment processes. Included are a Paypal system (for paid courses) with instant access, arbitrary external database usage, parsing of flatfiles dumped from legay systems and so on.</li>
      <li>Improved <strong>Resource</strong> handling with a new one step process and better control over display format. New resource types can be developed as plugins. </li>
      <li>Refactored <strong>Quiz</strong> module allows new question types as plugins. A new question type called Calculated Questions allows questions to be presented uniquely to each student.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat</strong> module now supports an optional chat daemon as a backend, providing near-instant response to hundreds of users. </li>
      <li>Improved <strong>Glossary</strong> module makes it easier to develop new glossary formats. </li>
      <li>Improved Backup handles the translation of user content (such as links) better than ever. </li>
      <li>Improved SCORM module handling an ever-wider range of SCORM content. </li>
      <li>Improved interfaces for adding students, course creators and administrators. </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Version 1.5  - Later in 2004</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This  release will focus mainly on the display layer and making Moodle fully compliant with important web accessibility standards such as WAI (W3C), SENDA (UK) and Section 508 (US). </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Completely rewritten display layer that completely separates presentation from application logic </li>
      <li>Templating system with templates conforming to XHTML 1.0 for accessibility</li>
      <li>Powerful system of Cascading Style Sheets designed for cross-platform compatibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As with most Moodle releases there will also be an array of new community-developed features and modules.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Version 2.0</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This major release will contain some exciting developments in making Moodle more network-aware, with a natural evolution of Moodle's focus on collaboration. More on this here later. </p>
