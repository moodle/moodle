<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>



<p class="normaltext">This page contains answers to some of the most 



  frequently asked questions by people installing Moodle. If you have 



  followed the <a href="./?file=install.html">installation instructions</a> but 



  you still have a problem, then this page is probably the best place to be. </p>



<p class="normaltext">If you don't find your answer here try the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/index.php?id=5" target="_top">Using 



  Moodle</a> course on moodle.org. Start by searching the forums using a few keywords, 

  in case your problem has already been discussed. If you don't find 

  anything, then try posting your question into the appropriate forum - somebody will 

  usually be able to help you.</p>



<p class="normaltext">If you have tried a number of solutions without resolving an issue,

and you are running behind a firewall, it may be advisable to try re-configuring your

firewall to ensure that it is not blocking a required function or necessary communication.

Firewalls very rarely cause problems with Moodle but are occasionally responsible for

reduced functionality due to a mis-configuration in the firewall settings.

<h3 class="question"><a name="filenotfound"></a>Whenever I try to access or view 



  a file that I uploaded, I get an error &quot;File not Found&quot;</h3>



<p class="answer">For example: Not Found: The requested URL /moodle/file.php/2/myfile.jpg 



  was not found on this server. </p>



<p class="answer">Your web server needs to be configured to allow the part of 



  the URL after a script name to be passed directly to the script. This is usually 



  enabled in Apache 1, but is usually disabled by default in Apache 2. To turn 



  it on, add this line to your httpd.conf, or to a .htaccess file in your local 



  directory (see the <a href="./?file=install.html#webserver">Install documentation</a> 



  for more details): </p>



<p class="answercode"><b>AcceptPathInfo</b> on</p>



<p class="answer">Note, this will ONLY work for Apache versions 2.x. </p>



<p class="answer">If you are not using Apache 2 and you still have this problem 



  (unlikely) then you can switch Moodle to use an alternative method. The disadvantages 



  are a slight loss of performance for your users and you won't be able to use 



  relative links within HTML resources. </p>



<p class="answer">To use this alternative method: login as Admin, go into the 



  "Configure Variables" page and change the setting for "<b>slasharguments</b>". 



  You should now be able to access your uploaded files.</p>



<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>



  



  <h4 class="question"><a name="php"></a>PHP - is it installed and what version 



  do I have?</h4>



  <p class="answer">Make a new file on your web site called info.php, containing the following 



    text, and call it from your browser:</p>



    



  <p class="answercode">&lt;?PHP phpinfo() ?&gt;</p>



<p class="answer">If nothing happens then you don't have PHP installed. See the 



  installation docs for some information about where to download it for your computer.</p>



<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="blankpages"></a>Why are all my pages blank? </h4> 



<p class="answer">Check the dirroot variable in config.php. You must use complete, 



  absolute pathnames, eg:</p>



<p class="answercode"> $CFG->dirroot = "d:\inetpub\sites\www.yoursite.com\web\moodle";</p>



<p>&nbsp; </p>



<p class="answer">Redhat Linux platform please see: <a href="http://moodle.org/doc/?file=installamp.html">Redhat Linux</a></p>



<p>&nbsp; </p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="errorgetstring"></a>My pages show fatal errors such 



  as : call to undefined function: get_string()</h4>



<p class="answer">If you see errors like:</p>



<p class="answercode">Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_VARIABLE in c:\program 



  files\easyphp\www\moodle\config.php on line 94 <br>



  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: get_string() in c:\program files\easyphp\www\moodle\mod\resource\lib.php 



  on line 11</p>



<p class="answer">then it's likely you have left out a semi-colon or ending quote 



  from a line in config.php (previous to line 94).</p>



<p class="answer">Another reason could be that you have opened config.php in a 



  program like Word to edit it, and saved it as a HTML web page, instead of a 



  proper text file.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="headerssent"></a>Why do I keep getting error messages 



  about &quot;headers already sent&quot;?</h4>



<p class="answer">If you see errors like this:</p>



<p class="answercode">Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 



  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 



  on line 1322 </p>



<p class="answercode"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 



  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 



  on line 1323 </p>



<p class="answercode"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 



  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/login/index.php 



  on line 54 </p>



<p class="answer">You have blank lines or spaces after the final ?> in your config.php 



  file. Sometimes text editors add these - for example Notepad on Windows - so 



  you may have to try a different text editor to remove these spaces or blank 



  lines completely. </p>



<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="failedopen"></a>I keep getting this error: Failed 



  opening required '/web/moodle/lib/setup.php'</h4>



<p class="answer">In your config.php, the setting that you use for the dirroot 



  variable must be the <strong>complete path from the root of your server's hard 



  drive</strong>.</p>



<p class="answer">Sometimes people only use the path from their home directory, 



  or relative to the root of the web server directory.</p>



<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="quotes" id="quotes"></a>Any text I add with an apostrophe 



  (') or a quote (&quot;) causes errors or comes up with a slash added</h4>



<p class="answer">Problems caused by apostrophes are caused by incorrect &quot;magic 



  quotes&quot; settings. Moodle requires the following settings (which are usually 



  the default):</p>



<p class="answercode">magic_quotes_gpc = On<br>



  magic_quotes_runtime = Off</p>



<p class="answer">See the section on <a href="./?file=install.html#webserver">webserver 

  configuration</a> in the Installation docs for more details.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>















<h4 class="question"><a name="sessiontmp"></a>I keep getting error messages about session_start</h4>



<p class="answer">If you see errors like this:</p>



<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/tmp\sess_d40f380d37d431fc1516e9a895ad9ce0, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>



<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/tmp\sess_d40f380d37d431fc1516e9a895ad9ce0, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>



<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent (output started at G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php:1) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>







<p class="answer">... these are all related to the fact that PHP is failing to save 



  "session" files on your hard disk (in a directory called /tmp).  Usually the 



  reason is that you don't HAVE a directory called /tmp on your computer.  This 



  is usually the case with Windows installations.







<p class="answer">The solution is to fix the PHP setting for this path to point to a real directory.  You can do this in your php.ini file:</p>



<p class="answercode">session.save_path = C:\temp</p>



<p class="answer">or otherwise in a .htaccess file in your main moodle directory:</p>



<p class="answercode">php_value session.save_path "/home/moodle/sessions"</p>

<p class="answercode">&nbsp;</p>







<h4 class="question"><a name="fixdirroot"></a>When I go to the admin page, I get told to make dirroot blank!</h4>



<p class="answer">If you see errors like this in Moodle 1.0.9:</p>







<table class=generalbox cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 align=center border=0>



<tbody>



<tr>



<td bgcolor=#ffbbbb>Please fix your settings in config.php: 



<p>You have: 



<p>$CFG-&gt;dirroot = "/home/users/fred/public_html/moodle"; 



<p>but it should be: 



<p>$CFG-&gt;dirroot = "";</p></td></tr></tbody></table>







<p class="answer">then you have encountered a small bug that occurs on some servers. The problem is with the error-checking mechanism, not with your actual path.  To fix it, find this line (line 66) in the file admin/index.php: </p>



<p class="answercode">if ($dirroot != $CFG->dirroot) {</p>



<p class="answer">and change it to this:</p>



<p class="answercode">if (!empty($dirroot) and $dirroot != $CFG->dirroot) {</p>

<p class="answercode">&nbsp;</p>





<h4 class="question"><a name="loginsetting"></a>I login but don't appear to be. I am logged in and can navigate freely.</h4>



<p class="answer">Make sure the URL in your $CFG->wwwroot setting is exactly the 

  same as the one you are actually using to access the site.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="resource1"></a>When trying to add a resource I receive error messages.</h4>



<p class="answer">Assuming you are using Apache, then it's quite likely that your 

  setting in config.php for $CFG->wwwroot is different from the actual URL you 

  are using to access the site. Also try turning off "<b>secureforms</b>" in the 

  admin settings.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>







<h4 class="question"><a name="noadmin"></a>During the initial setting-up process, I never get asked to create an admin account!</h4>



<p class="answer">This is a known bug in versions of Moodle up to 1.0.9, now fixed in the main code and version 1.1.</p>



<p class="answer">It doesn't affect all people, it only occurs when the person installing Moodle has a

  cookie in their browser from another program on the same site, called "user", "admin", or "teacher".</p>



<p class="answer">Quick fixes include deleting those cookies from your browser before installing, using a different browser, or editing the file moodle/admin/user.php to insert these lines near the top:</p>



<p class="answercode">unset($user);<br />unset($admin);<br />unset($teacher);</p>



<p class="answer">After performing any of these fixes it might be a good idea 

  to drop all the tables in your database and re-install again from scratch.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>







<h4 class="question"><a name="nologin"></a>I can't log in - I just stay stuck on the login screen.</h4>



<p class="answer">The most common cause for this is that your own computer (not your Moodle server) 

                  has a firewall that is stripping referrer information from the browser.</p>



<p class="answer">This can be fixed for everyone using your server by editing the Moodle configuration 

                  page and changing the variable "<b>secureforms</b>" to "No".</p>



<p class="answer">Another possible cause of this problem is that sessions are 

  not configured properly on the server. You can test this by calling the script 

  http://yourserver/moodle/lib/session-test.php.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>







<h4 class="question"><a name="backup"></a>How do I backup my whole Moodle site?</h4>



<p class="answer">There are two main things you need to make a copy of: the database and the uploaded files.  The Moodle scripts themselves are less important, since you can always download a fresh copy if you have to.</p>



<p class="answer">There are many ways to do such backups.  Here is an outline of a little script you can run on Unix to backup the database (it works well to have such a script run daily via a cron task</p>

<p class="answercode">cd /my/backup/directory</p>

<p class="answercode">mv moodle-database.sql.gz moodle-database-old.sql.gz</p>

<p class="answercode">mysqldump -h example.com -u myusername --password=mypassword -C -Q -e -a mydatabasename > moodle-database.sql</p>

<p class="answercode">gzip moodle-database.sql</p>

<p class="answer">For the files, you can use rsync regularly to copy only the changed files to another host:</p>

<p class="answercode">rsync -auvtz --delete -e ssh mysshusername@example.com:/my/server/directory 

  /my/backup/directory/</p>

<p class="answercode">&nbsp;</p>





<h4 class="question"><a name="locale"></a>Why doesn't my Moodle site display the time & date correctly?</h4>



<p class="answer">Each language requires a specific language code (called a <strong>locale</strong> 

  code) to allow dates to be displayed correctly. The language packs contain default 

  standard codes, but sometimes these don't work on Windows servers. </p>

<p class="answer">You can find the correct locale codes for Windows on these two 

  pages: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_language_strings.asp" target="_blank">Language 

  codes</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_country_strings.asp" target="_blank">Country/region 

  codes</a>.(eg &quot;esp_esp&quot; for spanish)</p>

<p class="answer">These new locale codes can be entered on the Admin -&gt; Configure 

  -&gt; Variables page, where they override the ones in the currently chosen language 

  pack.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="cron"></a>Email copies are not being sent 

  from my forums </h4>

<p class="answer">You <strong>must</strong> set up cron properly if you want Moodle 

  to send out automatic email from forums, journals, assignments etc. This same 

  process also performs a number of clean-up tasks such as deleting old unconfirmed 

  users, unenrolling old students and so on.</p>

<p class="answer">Basically, you need to set up a process to regularly call the 

  script http://yoursite/admin/cron.php. Please see <a href="./?file=install.html#cron">the 

  section on cron in the Installation documentation</a>.</p>

<p class="answer">Tip: Try the default setting in Moodle variables page. Leave the smtphost blank.

This will be acceptable for the majority of users.
