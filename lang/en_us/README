US English is only slightly different from standard English.

Only a few words are changed, like :

  enrolment -> enrollment
  colour    -> color

Note that many help files and strings may be missing but this
doesn't matter much.  Because the "parent language" of this 
pack is "en", missing strings will be taken from there.
