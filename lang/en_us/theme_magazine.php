If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme was coded and is maintained by John Stabinger of NewSchool Learning.
