README FOR LANGUAGE PLUGIN
--------------------------

This directory contains all the strings and texts needed
to render a Moodle site in a particular language.

The default language is English.  If a string is missing 
for any reason from another language, then the English 
version will be used.

Note that each installed module should have a file here,
as well as the main file which is called "moodle.php".

The "help" directory contains whole pages written in HTML,
and the "docs" directory contains other miscellaneous 
documents.

If you are thinking of translating Moodle to another language,
please contact me so I can help you!

Cheers,
