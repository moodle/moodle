<h1>Require grade</h1>

<p>
When this option is turned on, students have to get a grade on the activity in 
order to complete it. For example, a quiz would be 
marked completed as soon as the user submits it.
</p>

<p>
It does not matter how well the student did. Getting any grade will mark
the activity completed.
</p>

<h2>Distinguishing between pass and fail</h2>

<p>
It is possible to distinguish between 'pass' and 'fail' grades so that the 
activity becomes 'completed, passed' or 'completed, not passed' instead of just
'completed'. These results show a different icon and alternative text. 
</p>

<p>
To set this up, you need to specify the pass value for this activity's 
individual grade:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the course gradebook by clicking the 'Grades' link on the course administration
block.</li>
<li>From the 'Choose an action' dropdown, pick 'Categories and items'.</li>
<li>Click the Edit icon next to the grade item for this activity.</li>
<li>Turn on 'Show Advanced'.</li>
<li>Type a grade value (e.g. 5.0) in the 'Grade to pass' box.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once you have done this, anybody submitting the quiz will receive either the
pass or fail completion icon. If the quiz can be taken multiple times, the 
completion icon will automatically update whenever the grade does.
</p>

<p>
There is one limitation: this only works if grades are immediately visible to 
students. The grade must be neither permanently hidden, nor hidden until a certain 
date. If a grade is hidden then only the standard 'completed' state will be
displayed - even once the hidden date has passed.
