<h1>Expect completed on</h1>

<p>
This optional field lets you associate a date with the activity. Dates do not
affect the behaviour of the system (for example, you can still complete an
activity after the date passes) and are not shown to students.
They are displayed only when viewing the progress report.
</p>

<p>
Teachers can use the dates on the progress report to help determine whether 
or not certain students might be falling behind. They could then decide to 
contact students and offer assistance.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to complete this field unless you want a date to show in the
progress report.
