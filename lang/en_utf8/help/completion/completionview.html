<h1>Require view</h1>

<p>
When this option is turned on, students have to view the activity in order
to complete it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>In most cases, clicking the link is enough to 'view' the activity.</li>
<li>You should usually not turn on the 'view' condition if you have other 
requirements - this makes extra work for the server and it's unlikely that a 
student could meet any other conditions without viewing the activity.</li>
</ul>
