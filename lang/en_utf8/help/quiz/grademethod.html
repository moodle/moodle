<h1>Grading method</h1>

<p>When multiple attempts are allowed, there are different ways
   you can use the grades to calculate the student's final 
   grade for the quiz.</p>

<p><b>Highest grade</b><p>
<ul>
<p>The final grade is the highest (best) grade in any attempt.</p>
</ul>

<p><b>Average grade</b><p>
<ul>
<p>The final grade is the average (simple mean) grade of all attempts.</p>
</ul>

<p><b>First grade</b><p>
<ul>
<p>The final grade is the grade gained on the first attempt (other attempts are ignored).</p>
</ul>

<p><b>Last grade</b><p>
<ul>
<p>The final grade is the grade gained on the most recent attempt only.</p>
</ul>
