MOODLE INSTALLATION
===================

This document provides a concise guide to installing Moodle. For a complete, detailed installation guide, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or later (8.x recommended). Required extensions: `curl`, `intl`, `json`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `pdo`, `xml`, `zip`.
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+ / PostgreSQL 9.6+ / Microsoft SQL Server 2017+.
- **Web server**: Apache (with `mod_rewrite`) or Nginx.
- **Optional but recommended**: Composer (for dependency management), Node.js (for building front‑end assets).

## Quick Installation Steps

1. **Place the files**: Extract the Moodle archive or clone the repository into your web server's document root.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git
   cd moodle
   ```

2. **Create a database**: Using your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, command line, etc.), create a new database and a user with full permissions on that database.

3. **Run the installer**: Open your browser and navigate to the Moodle directory (e.g., `http://localhost/moodle`). The installation script (`install.php`) will start automatically.

4. **Follow the on‑screen instructions**:
   - Select your language.
   - Confirm the paths and web address.
   - Choose the database driver and enter the connection details (database name, user, password, host).
   - The installer will create the necessary tables and set up the configuration file (`config.php`).
   - Create an administrator account.

5. **Set up cron**: Moodle requires a scheduled task to perform background jobs. You can:
   - Add a cron entry that runs every minute:
     ```bash
     * * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/moodle/admin/cron.php >/dev/null
     ```
   - Or use the "web cron" option (less reliable) during installation.

## Additional Notes

- **Docker**: If you prefer using Docker, you can use the official Moodle Docker images or community‑maintained images. See the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Docker) for details.
- **Development setup**: For a development environment, you may want to enable debugging, install additional tools (Xdebug, Grunt), and use the `git` workflow described in the [developer documentation](https://moodledev.io).

## Troubleshooting

- **File permissions**: Ensure the web server has write access to the `data` directory and the `config.php` file.
- **Missing PHP extensions**: The installer will check for required extensions and warn you if any are missing.
- **Database connection errors**: Verify that the database user has the correct privileges and that the database host is reachable.

Good luck and have fun!
