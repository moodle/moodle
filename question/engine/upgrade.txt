This files describes API changes for the core question engine.


=== 2.9 ===

1) Some new methods on the question_usage class (and corresponding methods on
   question_attempt, question_attempt_step, question_usage_observer, ... requried
   to implement them, but almost certainly you should only be calling the
   question_usage methods from your code.

   * question_usage::add_question_in_place_of_other($slot, $question, $maxmark = null)

     This creates a new questoin_attempt in place of an existing one, moving the
     existing question_attempt to the end of the usage, in a new slot number.
     The new slot number is returned. The goal is to replace the old attempt, but
     not lose the old data.

   * question_usage::set_question_max_mark($slot, $maxmark)

     Sets the max mark for one question in this usage. Previously, you could
     only change this using the bulk operation question_usage::set_max_mark_in_attempts;

   * question_usage::set_question_attempt_metadata($slot, $name, $value);
     question_usage::get_question_attempt_metadata($slot, $name);

     You can now record metadata, that is, values stored by name, against
     question_attempts. The question engine ignores this data (other than storing
     and loading it) but you may find it useful in your code.

   To see examples of where these are used, look at the chagnes from MDL-40992.

2) New fields in question_display_options, ->extrainfocontent and ->extrahistorycontent.
   These default to blank, but can be used to inject extra content into those parts
   of the question display. If you have overridden the methods in
   core_question_renderer that use these fields, you may need to update your renderer.


=== 2.6 ===

1) The method question_behaviour::is_manual_grade_in_range and move and become
   question_engine::is_manual_grade_in_range.

2) The arguments to core_question_renderer::mark_summary changed from
   ($qa, $options) to ($qa, $behaviouroutput, $options). If you have overridden
   that method you will need to update your code.

3) Heading level for number(), add_part_heading() and respond_history()
   has been lowered by one level. These changes are part of improving the page
   accessibility and making heading to have proper nesting. (MDL-41615)
