  Scenario: import Numerical question.
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question import" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I upload "question/type/numerical/tests/fixtures/testquestion.moodle.xml" file to "Import" filemanager
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    Then I should see "Parsing questions from import file."
    And I should see "Importing 1 questions from file"
    And I should see "1. What is the average of 4, 5, 6 and 10?"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I should see "Numerical-001"
