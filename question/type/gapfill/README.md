A very easy to use Cloze question type that supports drag/drop answers that work on mobile devices and the mobile app. For custom development and consultancy contact Moodle Partner Catalyst EU (https://www.catalyst-eu.net/).

Teachers can define the question with square braces to define the missing words. For example The [cat] sat on the [mat].
Alternative delimiting characters can be defined during question edit for example The #cat# sat on the #mat# can be valid.

If the dropdown or dragdrop options are set in the question edit form, it can display a shuffled selection  of correct and
wrong answers. These can then can be selected via dropddropdown lists or javascript powered drag and drop functionality.
