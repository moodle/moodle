This file describes core qbank plugin changes in /question/bank/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.0 ===

* This plugin type is new in Moodle 4.0. It is for adding features to the question bank.
  They key entry point is the class plugin_feature in the plugin namespace. This tells
  the core question bank API exactly which features this plugin implements.
  These features can currently be new columns in the question bank display, and bulk actions.
  Currently, actions on single questions are implemented as a type of column (but this
  should probably change in the future.) To get started, have a look at the methods
  in core_question\local\bank\plugin_features_base which you can override.
