This files describes API changes for code that uses MFA.

=== 4.4 ===
* The method tool_mfa\output\renderer::setup_factor() has been deprecated. The HTML derived from this method is no longer needed.
  Similar HTML is now achieved as part of available_factors() from MFA renderer.
* The class tool_mfa\local\form\revoke_factor_form is renamed to factor_action_confirmation_form to better suit the other actions
  it is performing (replace and revoke).
