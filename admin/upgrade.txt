This files describes API changes in /admin/*.

=== 4.1 ===

* A new admin setting supportavailability allows admins to configure who the "contact site support" feature is available to
  (everyone, authenticated users, or nobody).
  -For new sites and those upgrading from 3.11.x or older, the default will be "Limited to authenticated users".
  -For sites upgrading from 4.0.x, the default will be "available to anyone visiting the site", to main consistent behaviour through the upgrade.

=== 4.0.1 ===

* A new callback xxx_pre_enable_plugin_actions has been added in admin/modules.php. Plugins can use this callback to
  force additional actions (e.g. displaying notifications, modals, etc.) before enabling the plugin. The expected
  return value (bool) from the plugin callback method specifies whether the process of enabling the plugin should
  continue after the added actions or not.

=== 3.11 ===

* New admin setting admin_setting_encryptedpassword allows passwords in admin settings to be
  encrypted (with the new \core\encryption API) so that even the admin cannot read them.
* Web services administration has been moved from Plugins into the Server category. If you have
  Behat tests containing steps like `Given I navigate to "Plugins > Web services > ..."`, you will
  want to replace them with `Given I navigate to "Server > Web services > ..."`.

=== 3.9 ===

* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-65809 for more info:
    - upgrade_fix_block_instance_configuration()
    - upgrade_theme_is_from_family()
    - upgrade_find_theme_location()
    - linkcoursesectionsupgradescriptwasrun setting
    - upgrade_block_positions()

=== 3.8 ===

* Admin setting "Open to Google" (opentogoogle) has been renamed to the more generic "Open to search engines" (opentowebcrawlers).
  This is a more accurate representation of what is being set and the config string has also been moved and updated to reflect this.

=== 3.7 ===

* Admin setting "Allow blocks to use the dock" (allowblockstodock) has been removed & stings deprecated.
  Docking of blocks is no longer supported within the core themes (Boost, Classic).
  Please see MDL-64506 for further details.

=== 3.3 ===

* The admin settings admin_setting_configselect and admin_setting_configmultiselect now support the optgroup tag.
  Grouping of options can be created with this new tag.
  For using it, the option parameters needs the Group names as indexes:
  [
    "Spain" =>  ["madrid" => "Madrid", "barcelona" => "Barcelona"],
    "France" => ["paris" => "Paris", "marseille" => "Marseille"],
  ]

=== 3.2 ===

* Admin settings have been refined to better support right-to-left languages. In RTL,
  most fields should not have their direction flipped, a URL, a path to a file, ...
  are always displayed LTR. The admin setting will now best guess if they should be
  RTLized based on their PARAM_* type. To override that guess, use
  admin_setting::set_force_ltr(true/false).
