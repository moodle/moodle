<H2>Introduction</H2>
 
<P>Moodle is a software package for producing internet-based courses and web sites. 
  It's an ongoing development project designed to support a <A HREF="http://dougiamas.com/writing/constructivism.html">social constructionist</A> framework of education. </P>

<P>Moodle is provided freely as <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html"> 
  Open Source</A> software (under the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"> 
  GNU Public License</A>).  Basically this means Moodle is copyrighted, but that you have additional 
  freedoms.  You are allowed to copy, use and modify Moodle <B>provided</B> that you agree: to provide 
  the source to others; to not modify or remove the original license, and apply this same 
  license to any derivative work.

<P>Moodle will run on any computer that can run <A HREF="http://www.php.net/"> 
  PHP</A>, and supports almost every brand of database.</P>

<P>The word Moodle is an acronym for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning 
  Environment, which is mostly useful to programmers and education theorists.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;It's also a verb that describes the process of lazily meandering through 
  something, doing things as it occurs to you to do them, an enjoyable tinkering 
  that often leads to insight and creativity. As such it applies both to the way 
  Moodle was developed, and to the way a student or teacher might approach studying 
  or teaching an online course.</P>
