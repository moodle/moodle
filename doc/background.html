<P>Moodle is an active and evolving work in progress.</P>
<P>I've been working on it, in some way or other, for several years. It started 
  in the 90's when I was webmaster at <a target=_top href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin University 
  of Technology</a> and a system administrator of their WebCT installation. I 
  encountered many frustrations with the WebCT beast and developed an itch that 
  needed scratching - there had to be a better way (no, not Blackboard :-)</P>
<P>I also know a lot of people in schools and smaller institutions (and some big 
  ones!) who want to make better use of the Internet but don't know where to start 
  in the maze of technologies and pedagogies that are out there. I've always hoped 
  there would be a Free alternative that such people could use to help them move 
  their teaching skills into the online environment.</P>
<P>My strong beliefs in the unrealised possibilities of Internet-based education 
  led me to complete a Masters and then a PhD in Education, combining my former 
  career in Computer Science with newly constructed knowledge about the nature 
  of learning and collaboration.</P>
<P>Since then Moodle has progressed through several very different prototypes 
  until the release of version 1.0 upon a largely unsuspecting world on 
  August 20, 2002 and a steady series of improved releases since then.
<P>I've been using it in several courses and find it an 
  extremely usable and reliable tool for building high-quality online courses 
  - others are reporting the same. Given the context in which it's been designed, 
  it works particularly well for smaller institutions, or for smaller, more intimate 
  classes.</P>
<P>When compared to the big commercial tools such as WebCT or Blackboard I think 
  it still falls short in some areas (such as scalability and standards support), 
  but it comes out ahead in many others (see <a href="features.html">Features</a>).
