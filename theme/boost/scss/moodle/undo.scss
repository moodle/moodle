/* block.invisible vs .invisible
 * block.hidden vs .invisible
 *
 * uses .invisible where the rest of Moodle uses @mixin dimmed
 * fixible in block renderer?
 *
 * There's seems to be even more naming confusion here since,
 * blocks can be actually 'visible' (or not) to students,
 * marked 'visible' but really just dimmed to indicate to editors
 * that students can't see them or  'visible' to the user who
 * collapses them, 'visible' if you have the right role and in
 * different circumstances different sections of a block can
 * be 'visible' or not.
 *
 * currently worked around in renderers.php function block{}
 * by rewriting the class name "invisible" to "dimmed",
 * though the blocks don't look particularly different apart
 * from their contents disappearing. Maybe try .muted? or
 * dimming all the edit icons apart from unhide, might be a
 * nice effect, though they'd still be active. Maybe reverse
 * it to white?

/* fieldset.hidden vs .hidden

 * uses hidden for stuff that is hidden in various responsive modes.
 *
 * Relatedly, there is also fieldset.invisiblefieldset which hides the
 * border and sets the display to inline.
 *
 * Originally this just set block and visible, but it is used
 * in random question dialogue in Quiz,
 * that dialogue is hidden and shown, so when hidden the
