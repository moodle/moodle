@theme @theme_snap
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to Snap, behat tests that navigate via the Nav block should still work
    even though this block is hidden by default in the Snap theme.

  Scenario: Log in as admin and always see the navigation block in behat
    Given I log in as "admin"
    Then ".block_navigation" "css_element" should exist
