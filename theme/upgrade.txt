This files describes API changes in /theme/* themes,
information provided here is intended especially for theme designer.

=== 2.5.1 ===

Notes:
* Block drag and drop functionality has been improved so that it works regardless of what block regions you use
  or how many block regions you have. In order to benefit from this improvement you must convert your calls from
  $OUTPUT->blocks_for_region() to $OUTPUT->blocks.

Optional changes:
* Theme config can nominate block regions to swap if the user is using a rtl languages such as Hebrew.
  $THEME->blockrtlmanipulations should be an associative array, the key is the original block region, and the
  value should be where the blocks in that region should be displayed.
* New $OUTPUT methods to replace code that was previously using $PAGE. Converting to these methods is optional
  but highly recommended. Refer to the bootstrapbase layouts for examples.
  - $OUTPUT->body_attributes() returns a string you can use for the body id and classes.
  - $OUTPUT->blocks() returns HTML to display a block region and all of its blocks. This adds data attributes
    that ensure drag and drop of blocks will work no matter what block regions or how many you have.
  - $OUTPUT->page_heading() returns the page heading. Replaces $PAGE->heading.
  - $OUTPUT->page_heading_button() returns the button to display with the heading. Replaces $page->button.
  - $OUTPUT->page_doc_link() returns the link to moodle docs for the page. Replaces page_doc_link().
  - $OUTPUT->page_heading_menu() returns the heading menu for the page. Replaces $PAGE->headingmenu.
  - $OUTPUT->page_title() Returns the title to use for the head section.
  - $OUTPUT->favicon() returns the URL to the favicon.

Renderer changes:
* core_renderer::navbar now returns an empty string if there are no navigation items to display.
* core_renderer::custom_menu now adds a class "custom_menu" to the div that contains the HTML for the custom menu.

=== 2.5 ===

required changes:
* Functions core_course_renderer::course_category_tree() and course_category_tree_category()
  are deprecated
* Significant changes in rendering of courses and categories listings, lots of CSS classes changed,
  several functions such as print_courses(), print_whole_category_list(), print_category_info()
  are moved to course renderer.
  See http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Courses_lists_upgrade_to_2.5

DOM changes:
* changed the h1 title in the help popup to a h2.
* new setting $THEME->yuicssmodules = array('cssreset', 'cssfonts', 'cssgrids', 'cssbase'); which
  allows themes to use different CSS reset normalisers such as cssnormalize YUI module.
* Re-wrote the user profile views to definition lists.
* Re-wrote the table for the course completion status block to use html_table - added some CSS classes to
  the table in the process (see MDL-35608).
* Cancel buttons have the class btn-cancel.
* Added a z-index for the div#dateselector-calendar-panel so that the calendar pop-up renders above
  the filemanager when they overlap, ie. the course settings page (see MDL-39047).
* Trivial change of CSS selectors used to display plugin status at the plugins overview
  screen (#plugins-control-panel).

Renderer changes:
