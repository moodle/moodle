 - badges_check_backpack_accessibility()
 - badges_setup_backpack_js()

* Users can now specify a backpack that differs from the site backpack. In order to do this, connection details need to
be set in 'Manage backpacks' with OR without auth details.

** badges_save_backpack_credentials() - This method handles inserts/updates any authentication details to connect to the backpacks created. This can either be site OR user backpack authentication details
** badges_get_user_backpack() - Gets a specific user's backpack. Defaults to current user's backpack if none provided.
** badges_get_site_primary_backpack() - Get the primary backpack set for the site as defined in $CFG->badges_site_backpack
* badges_open_badges_backpack_api() - Now accepts a backpackid(badge_external_backpack id) to check whether the version of the provided backpack.
  This was introduced because now there is a difference between a site and user backpack. If null, defaults to site_backpack.
* badges_get_site_backpack() - Accepts an additional $userid param if we want to get a specific user's backpack. Defaults to 0 if we are trying to get the site/admin level backpack
* badges_external_get_mapping() - Accepts an additional argument to indicate which value it wants returned. Defaults to 'externalid' which contains the OBv2 badge URL

* get_completed_criteria_sql() - This method was added to award_criteria class and must be overriden
  in all criteria classes. This method returns an array consisting of SQL JOIN statement, WHERE conditions,
  and any parameters that might be required. The results are used in lib/badgeslib.php in review_all_criteria()
  to reduce to the minimum the number of users to review and award badges.
* New optional parameter $filtered in review() allows to indicate that some expensive checks can be skipped
  if the list of users has been initially filtered based on met criteria.
* New optional parameter $archive in delete() in badge class in badgeslib.php
  allows to indicate that a badge should be archived instead of fully deleted.

  and awards will be removed from the database.
