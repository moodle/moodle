<b>Help</b>
</font>
<p>
If there appears to be a problem with the way the software is behaving it can be useful to use the two tools under the Debug menu, which is under the Help menu. These can show the current expression as a tree, and outline the borders of all the objects on the workspace.
Under the Help menu there is also a link to the Online Documentation.
