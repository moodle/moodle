<h3>ADOdb Library for PHP</h3>
<p>ADOdb is a suite of database libraries that allow you to connect to multiple 
	databases in a portable manner.</p>

<p>The ADOdb documentation has moved to <a href=docs-adodb.htm>docs-adodb.htm</a> 
	This allows you to query, update and insert records using a portable API.
<p>The ADOdb data dictionary docs are at <a href=docs-datadict.htm>docs-datadict.htm</a>. 
	This allows you to create database tables and indexes in a portable manner.
<p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
Make sure you are running PHP4.0.4 or later. Unpack all the files into a directory accessible by your webserver.
<p>
To test, try modifying some of the tutorial examples. Make sure you customize the connection settings correctly. You can debug using:
<pre>
&lt;?php
include('adodb/adodb.inc.php');

$db = <b>ADONewConnection</b>($driver); # eg. 'mysql' or 'oci8' 
$db->debug = true;
$db-><b>Connect</b>($server, $user, $password, $database);
$rs = $db-><b>Execute</b>('select * from some_small_table');
print "&lt;pre>";
print_r($rs-><b>GetRows</b>());
print "&lt;/pre>";
?>
</pre>
