		Installing the Free UCS outline fonts
		=====================================

1. UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems

The rather awkward "UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD" agglomeration is used to
denote any system capable of running XFree86 server with FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org/>, a high-quality free font rasterizer.

1.1 KDE local installation

Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis using the KDE 
Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which may appear in the menu as

	Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

This is especially helpful for developers and testers.

1.2 Debian GNU/Linux

Users of Debian GNU/Linux system will probably want to use the
pre-packed Debian package, as available from the Debian site, 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html>, or
any of its mirrors. You can install them by issuing the command

apt-get install ttf-freefont


1.3 The rough way

1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS outline fonts
   in the TrueType format.

2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory,
   e.g. /usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the directory you
   used to install the fonts is listed in the path searched by the X
   Font Server. Append the directory to the "catalogue=" in the
   /etc/X11/fs/config.

4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the fonts.


2. Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP

   Probably something like Windows Vista:

   Microsoft Windows Vista
      * From Start menu, open Control Panels
      * drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
        may get dialog saying
        "Windows needs your permission to continue"
        * click Continue


3. MacOS X

Installing on Mac OS X requires moving the .ttf files to either
/Library/Fonts/ or ~/Library/Fonts/ depending on whether they should be
available to all users on your system or just to yourself.
