  Spike PHPCoverage 0.8.2 
===========================

1. Introduction
===============

  Spike PHPCoverage is an open-source tool for measuring and reporting code 
  coverage provided by the test suite of a PHP application. 
  Spike PHPCoverage can instrument and record the line coverage information 
  for any PHP script at runtime.

  Spike PHPCoverage also provides an extensible reporting mechanism with a 
  standard HTML report implemented out of the box. The default report 
  displays the summary information about the code coverage for an application 
  and also shows the detailed information about a file including which 
  lines were actually executed and with what frequency. It is possible 
  to specify the directories and files that should be included and/or 
  excluded from a coverage measurement. Screen shots of the summary and 
  detailed line coverage reports are available at 
  http://www.spikesource.com/projects/phpcoverage/screenshots.php

  Spike PHPCoverage works on PHP 5.0 and newer and uses XDebug Zend Extension 
  for gathering the coverage data.
