    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * none

    Context variables required for this template:
    * pix
    * title
    * extraclasses

    Example context (json):
    {
        "key": "fa-meh-o",
        "title": "Meh",
        "alt": "Meh Meh",
        "extraclasses": "fa-spin",
        "unmappedIcon": false
    }

}}
{{^unmappedIcon}}
<i class="icon fa {{key}} fa-fw {{extraclasses}}" aria-hidden="true" title="{{title}}" aria-label="{{alt}}"></i>
{{/unmappedIcon}}
{{#unmappedIcon}}
{{! We cannot include the pix_icon template directly here because we don't have all the mustache helpers loaded. }}
