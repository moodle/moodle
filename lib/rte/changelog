Version DEV

- Added multi-lingual support.  The editor detects the userLanguage
  of the browser and uses this select the relevent language from the
  new rte_lang.js module which is then applied to the main editor
  window.  This is a work in progress, dialog need translation also.

- Re-implemented Undo/Redo (history) option this time using the
  document.execCommand('Undo'/'Redo') options which although 
  documented as not implemented do work in IE 6.0.

Version 0.2.3

- Improved option handling to maintain an array of options that are
  not "features" and added a getOption() private method to obtain
  the current option value.

- The saveHistory() function is now a no-op if the history option is
  not enabled.  Previously it was still doing all the buffer saving
  behind the scenes.  This should improve the performance of the
  editor.

- Corrected version and company information in the about dialog.

- Remove showHistory() status (debug) messages

- After set editor options, apply them.  In most circumstances the
  options property is set after the editor has initialised and so
  the options need to be processed as the options are set not
  when the editor is initialised.

- Added numerous options:
    styleBar=yes|no      default yes
    style=yes|no         default yes
    font=yes|no          default yes
    fontSize=yes|no      default yes
    colour=yes|no        default yes
    dragdrop=yes|no      default no

- Added code to disable drag and drop in the editor.  Previously
  it was possible to drag a toolbar button and drop a copy of it
  into the editor window.  Now, nothing can be dragged from the
  toolbar and nothing can be dropped into the editor window.
  This does not disable any functionality because the editor
  window did not act as a drop target for objects from outside
  of the IE control.  It was however possible to drag elements
  from one page and drop them into the editor, this is now not
  possible unless dragdrop=yes is specified.  However, the 
  dragdrop handling is weak (non-existent) and so is disabled
  by default.

- Some minor cosmetic changes to the toolbar.

- Added debug window functionality to aid development and support
  of the editor.  Over time, diagnostic debugs will be added to
  the editor code.

- Default edit area to not editable (effectivly disabled) until
  inisialisation of the editor is complete.

- Added Full Justify Option

- Re-worked font color/back color resetting (color none) so that
  a) it worked and b) it only removes the fore/background color
  and preserves the other formatting that bit of text may have.

- Disable post button when in view source mode.  The post button
  is greyed out whilst disabled.
