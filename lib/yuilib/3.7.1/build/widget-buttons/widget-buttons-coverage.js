WidgetButtons.ATTRS = {
    /**
    Collection containing a widget's buttons.

    The collection is an Object which contains an Array of `Y.Node`s for every
    `WidgetStdMod` section (header, body, footer) which has one or more buttons.
    All button nodes have the `Y.Plugin.Button` plugin applied.

    This attribute is very flexible in the values it will accept. `buttons` can
    be specified as a single Array, or an Object of Arrays keyed to a particular
    section.

    All specified values will be normalized to this type of structure:

        {
            header: [...],
            footer: [...]
        }

    A button can be specified as a `Y.Node`, config Object, or String name for a
    predefined button on the `BUTTONS` prototype property. When a config Object
    is provided, it will be merged with any defaults provided by a button with
    the same `name` defined on the `BUTTONS` property.

    See `addButton()` for the detailed list of configuration properties.

    For convenience, a widget's buttons will always persist and remain rendered
    after header/body/footer content updates. Buttons should be removed by
    updating this attribute or using the `removeButton()` method.

    @example
        {
            // Uses predefined "close" button by string name.
            header: ['close'],

            footer: [
                {
                    name  : 'cancel',
                    label : 'Cancel',
                    action: 'hide'
                },

                {
                    name     : 'okay',
                    label    : 'Okay',

    /**
    Adds a button to this widget.

    The new button node will have the `Y.Plugin.Button` plugin applied, be added
    to this widget's `buttons`, and rendered in the specified `section` at the
    specified `index` (or end of the section when no `index` is provided). If
    the section does not exist, it will be created.

    This fires the `buttonsChange` event and adds the following properties to
    the event facade:

      * `button`: The button node or config object to add.

      * `section`: The `WidgetStdMod` section (header/body/footer) where the
        button will be added.

      * `index`: The index at which the button will be in the section.

      * `src`: "add"

    **Note:** The `index` argument will be passed to the Array `splice()`
    method, therefore a negative value will insert the `button` that many items
    from the end. The `index` property on the `buttonsChange` event facade is
    the index at which the `button` was added.

    @method addButton
    @param {Node|Object|String} button The button to add. This can be a `Y.Node`
        instance, config Object, or String name for a predefined button on the
        `BUTTONS` prototype property. When a config Object is provided, it will
        be merged with any defaults provided by any `srcNode` and/or a button
        with the same `name` defined on the `BUTTONS` property. The following
        are the possible configuration properties beyond what Node plugins
        accept by default:
      @param {Function|String} [button.action] The default handler that should
        be called when the button is clicked. A String name of a Function that
        exists on the `context` object can also be provided. **Note:**
        Specifying a set of `events` will override this setting.
      @param {String|String[]} [button.classNames] Additional CSS classes to add
        to the button node.
      @param {Object} [button.context=this] Context which any `events` or
        `action` should be called with. Defaults to `this`, the widget.
        **Note:** `e.target` will access the button node in the event handlers.
      @param {Boolean} [button.disabled=false] Whether the button should be
        disabled.
      @param {String|Object} [button.events="click"] Event name, or set of
        events and handlers to bind to the button node. **See:** `Y.Node.on()`,
        this value is passed as the first argument to `on()`.
      @param {Boolean} [button.isDefault=false] Whether the button is the
        default button.
      @param {String} [button.label] The visible text/value displayed in the
        button.
      @param {String} [button.name] A name which can later be used to reference
        this button. If a button is defined on the `BUTTONS` property with this
        same name, its configuration properties will be merged in as defaults.
      @param {String} [button.section] The `WidgetStdMod` section (header, body,
        footer) where the button should be added.
      @param {Node} [button.srcNode] An existing Node to use for the button,
        default values will be seeded from this node, but are overriden by any
        values specified in the config object. By default a new &lt;button&gt;
        node will be created.
      @param {String} [button.template] A specific template to use when creating
        a new button node (e.g. "&lt;a /&gt;"). **Note:** Specifying a `srcNode`
        will overide this.
    @param {String} [section="footer"] The `WidgetStdMod` section
        (header/body/footer) where the button should be added. This takes
        precedence over the `button.section` configuration property.
    @param {Number} [index] The index at which the button should be inserted. If
        not specified, the button will be added to the end of the section. This
        value is passed to the Array `splice()` method, therefore a negative
        value will insert the `button` that many items from the end.
