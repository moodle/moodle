    Each returned route object has the following properties:

      * `callback`: A function or a string representing the name of a function

        This regex is used to determine whether the route matches a given path.

        // => [{callback: ..., keys: [], path: '/foo', regex: ...}]

    Behind the scenes, this method uses HTML5 `pushState()` in browsers that

    URL.

    The specified URL must share the same origin (i.e., protocol, host, and
    port) as the current page, or an error will occur.

    @example

    /**
    Adds a route handler for the specified URL _path_.

    The _path_ parameter may be either a string or a regular expression. If it's
    a string, it may contain named parameters: `:param` will match any single
    part of a URL path (not including `/` characters), and `*param` will match
    any number of parts of a URL path (including `/` characters). These named
    parameters will be made available as keys on the `req.params` object that's
    passed to route handlers.

    If the _path_ parameter is a regex, all pattern matches will be made
    available as numbered keys on `req.params`, starting with `0` for the full
    match, then `1` for the first subpattern match, and so on.

    Here's a set of sample routes along with URL paths that they match:

      * Route: `/photos/:tag/:page`
        * URL: `/photos/kittens/1`, params: `{tag: 'kittens', page: '1'}`
        * URL: `/photos/puppies/2`, params: `{tag: 'puppies', page: '2'}`

      * Route: `/file/*path`
        * URL: `/file/foo/bar/baz.txt`, params: `{path: 'foo/bar/baz.txt'}`
        * URL: `/file/foo`, params: `{path: 'foo'}`

    If multiple route handlers match a given URL, they will be executed in the
    order they were added. The first route that was added will be the first to
    be executed.

    @example
        controller.route('/photos/:tag/:page', function (req, next) {
        });

    @method route
    @param {String|RegExp} path Path to match. May be a string or a regular
      expression.
    @param {Function|String} callback Callback function to call whenever this
        route is triggered. If specified as a string, the named function will be
        called on this controller instance.
      @param {Object} callback.req Request object containing information about
          the request. It contains the following properties.
        @param {Array|Object} callback.req.params Captured parameters matched by
          the route path specification. If a string path was used and contained
          named parameters, then this will be a key/value hash mapping parameter
          names to their matched values. If a regex path was used, this will be
          an array of subpattern matches starting at index 0 for the full match,
          then 1 for the first subpattern match, and so on.
        @param {String} callback.req.path The current URL path.
        @param {Object} callback.req.query Query hash representing the URL query
          string, if any. Parameter names are keys, and are mapped to parameter
          values.
      @param {Function} callback.next Callback to pass control to the next
        matching route. If you don't call this function, then no further route
        handlers will be executed, even if there are more that match. If you do
        call this function, then the next matching route handler (if any) will
