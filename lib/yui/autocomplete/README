AutoComplete Release Notes

*** version 2.5.0 ***

* Fixed bug where Mac users were not able to input "&" or "(" characters.



*** version 2.4.0 ***

* Support for YUI JSON Utility.

* The allowBrowserAutocomplete property now supports cases when the user navigates
away from page via mean other than a form submission.

* Added support for integration with the Get Utility, for proxyless data
retrieval from dynamically loaded script nodes.

* Typing 'Enter' to select item no longer causes automatic form submission on
Mac browsers.



*** version 2.3.1 ***

* AutoComplete no longer throw a JavaScript error due to an invalid or
non-existent parent container. While a wrapper DIV element is still expected in
order to enable skinning (see 2.3.0 release note), a lack of such will not
cause an error.

* When suggestion container is collapsed, Mac users no longer need to type
Enter twice to submit input.



*** version 2.3.0 ***

* Applied new skinning model. Please note that in order to enable skinning,
AutoComplete now expects a wrapper DIV element around the INPUT element and the
container DIV element, in this fashion:

<div id="myAutoComplete">
    <input type="text" id="myInput">
    <div id="myContainer"></div>
</div>

* The default queryDelay value has been changed to 0.2. In low-latency
implementations (e.g., when queryDelay is set to 0 against a local
JavaScript DataSource), typeAhead functionality may experience a race condition
when retrieving the value of the textbox. To avoid this problem, implementers
are advised not to set the queryDelay value too low.

* Fixed runtime property value validation.

* Implemented new method doBeforeSendQuery().

* Implemented new method destroy().

* Added support for latest JSON lib http://www.json.org/json.js.

* Fixed forceSelection issues with matched selections and multiple selections.

* No longer create var oAnim in global scope.

* The properties alwaysShowContainer and useShadow should not be enabled together.

* There is a known issue in Firefox where the native browser autocomplete
attribute cannot be disabled programmatically on input boxes that are in use.
