*** version 2.5.2 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Mousing over a Menu instance will no longer result in the JavaScript error "oItem has 
  no properties"

+ When using a custom skin, a Menu instance's width will no longer continue to increase in IE each 
  time it is displayed.

+ Menu no longer blocks the display of the browser's default context menu when right clicking on a 
  MenuItem instance in Firefox 2 for Windows or Firefox 3.

+ Fixed the behavior of the "clicktohide" configuration property so that the property properly 
  cascades to all submenus when a Menu instance's "position" configuration property is set to 
  "dynamic".

+ Rolled back a change introduced in 2.5.0 that modified the behavior of submenus so that they are 
  no longer hidden then re-shown when the mouse is moving from a visible submenu back to its parent 
  MenuItem instance.  This change in 2.5.0 introduced a problem where multiple submenus of a menu
  could end up being displayed at once.  Currently targeting to restore the behavior introduced in 
  2.5.0 in 2.6.0.



*** version 2.5.1 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ The "url" configuration property of YAHOO.widget.MenuItem now returns the exact value of the 
  "href" attribute of its anchor element in Internet Explorer. 

+ Clicking on an item in a Menu will no longer cause Firefox to scroll to the top of the window.

+ Improved Menu's viewport boundary awareness.



*** version 2.5.0 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Corrected the paths to all images in the original Menu CSS file so that checked MenuItems now
  render correctly.

+ Clicking on a disabled MenuItem instance will no longer cause the browser to navigate to 
  the top of the current page.

+ Removed the use of the "yui-skin-sam" class name from the Menu core CSS file.

+ Scrolling Menus now render correctly in IE 6 and IE 7.

+ Submenus are no longer hidden then re-shown when the mouse is moving from a visible submenu back
  to its parent MenuItem instance.



*** version 2.4.1 ***

+ No changes



*** version 2.4.0 ***


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ The "context" property of YAHOO.widget.Menu works better in IE 6.

+ Immediate submenus of a YAHOO.widget.MenuBar instance will now re-align 
  themselves to their parent YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem instance to remain inside 
  the boundaries of the browser viewport when the "constraintoviewport" 
  property is set to "true."

+ A submenu will now appear in the correct position when its parent menu 
  is scrolled.

+ YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instances will no longer increase in height when their
  submenu is made visible.

+ Removed superfluous white space between YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instances in 
  IE 6 (Strict Mode and Quirks Mode) and IE 7 (Quirks Mode).
  
+ Statically positioned YAHOO.widget.MenuBar instances will no longer be 
  rendered in the wrong position when the Container CSS file is included in 
  the page.

+ Usage of the "maxheight" configuration property will no longer change the 
  position of a YAHOO.widget.Menu instance's shadow element 
  (<DIV class="yui-menu-shadow">).  The shadow element will alway be the last 
  child node of a menu's root element.

+ YAHOO.widget.MenuBar instances with their "position" configuration property 
  set to "dynamic" are no longer rendered with scrollbars in Firefox for 
  Mac OS X.
		


Added the following features:
-----------------------------

+ Added a new "minscrollheight" configuration property to YAHOO.widget.Menu
  that defines the minimum threshold for the "maxheight" configuration property.

+ Added a new "scrollincrement" configuration property to YAHOO.widget.Menu 
  which can be used to increase or decrease the scroll speed of scolled menu.

+ Hidden YAHOO.widget.Menu instances are now positioned off screen to 
  prevent them from introducing scrollbars on the browser viewport.  The 
  default off-screen position is -10000 for both the x and y coordinates and is
  defined in a new constant: "YAHOO.widget.Menu.prototype.OFF_SCREEN_POSITION".
  The method responsible for moving a menu off the screen is 
  "YAHOO.widget.Menu.prototype.positionOffScreen" which is called in response
  to the firing of the "hide" event.
    

Changes:
--------

+ Setting "iframe" configuration property on a YAHOO.widget.MenuBar instance
  will now result in the property cascading down to all submenus.

+ The "position" configuration property no longer automatically enables the 
  iframe shim for YAHOO.widget.Menu instances.  Previously, setting the 
  "position" configuration property to "static" would automatically 
  set the "iframe" configuration property to "false," and setting "position" to
  "dynamic" would set the "iframe" configuration property to "true" for IE 6.

+ YAHOO.widget.Menu instances no longer have their widths set automatically 
  as they are rendered.

+ Modified the DOM structure for a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance so that the 
  submenu indicator node (<EM class="submenuindicator" />) and checked 
  indicator node (<EM class="checkedindicator" />) that were previously direct 
  descendants of the <A/> node are no longer present.  The updated DOM
  structure of a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance is now:

    <LI class="yuimenuitem">
    
        <A class="yuimenuitemlabel">
    
            Text Label
    
            <EM class="helptext"> Help Text </EM>   (Optional)
    
        </A>
    
        <DIV class="yuimenu"> ... </DIV> (Optional submenu node)
    
    </LI>


  With the removal of the submenu indicator and checked indicator nodes,
  the following YAHOO.widget.MenuItem constants, used to define the inner 
  text of these nodes, have been removed:

    - YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.COLLAPSED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT
    - YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.EXPANDED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT
    - YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.DISABLED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT
    - YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.CHECKED_TEXT
    - YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.DISABLED_CHECKED_TEXT
    
  The "submenuIndicator" property of YAHOO.widget.MenuItem has also 
  been removed.


+ Modified the CSS class names used to represent the state of 
  YAHOO.widget.MenuItem and YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem instances.  Previous to 
  2.4.0 the following CSS class names were applied only to the <A> element 
  representing the text label for YAHOO.widget.MenuItem and 
  YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem instances:

    + hashelptext
    + checked
    + hassubmenu
    + selected
    + disabled


  To provide more flexibility and facilitate easier styling of state, a set of
  new CSS class names have been created that are applied to both the root 
  <LI> node and its child <A> node for YAHOO.widget.MenuItem and 
  YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem instances:
  

    New YAHOO.widget.MenuItem CSS classes:
    --------------------------------------
    
    The following are applied to the <LI> element:
    
    .yuimenuitem-hassubmenu
    .yuimenuitem-checked
    .yuimenuitem-selected
    .yuimenuitem-disabled
    
    .yuimenuitem-checked-selected
    .yuimenuitem-checked-disabled
    
    .yuimenuitem-hassubmenu-selected
    .yuimenuitem-hassubmenu-disabled
    

    The following are applied to the <A> element:

    .yuimenuitemlabel-hassubmenu
    .yuimenuitemlabel-checked
    .yuimenuitemlabel-selected
    .yuimenuitemlabel-disabled
    
    .yuimenuitemlabel-checked-selected
    .yuimenuitemlabel-checked-disabled
    
    .yuimenuitemlabel-hassubmenu-selected
    .yuimenuitemlabel-hassubmenu-disabled


    New YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem CSS classes:
    -----------------------------------------
    
    The following are applied to the <LI> element:
    
    .yuimenubaritem-hassubmenu
    .yuimenubaritem-selected
    .yuimenubaritem-disabled
    
    .yuimenubaritem-hassubmenu-selected
    .yuimenubaritem-hassubmenu-disabled
    

    The following are applied to the <A> element:
    
    .yuimenubaritemlabel-hassubmenu
    .yuimenubaritemlabel-selected
    .yuimenubaritemlabel-disabled
    
    .yuimenubaritemlabel-hassubmenu-selected
    .yuimenubaritemlabel-hassubmenu-disabled


+ Deprecated the YAHOO.widget.ContextMenuItem class and replaced it 
  with YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.

+ All submenus of a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance are now of type
  YAHOO.widget.Menu.

+ Updated the behavior of the "clicktohide" configuration property of 
  YAHOO.widget.Menu so that it behaves as documented: controls whether or not 
  clicking outside a menu results in the menu hiding.



*** version 2.3.1 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Including the Container CSS along with Menu CSS on a page will no longer 
  result in statically positioned Menu instances rendering as hidden.

+ The focus outline for MenuItem instances no longer sticks in Opera.

+ Clicking MenuItem instances without a value for the "url" configuration 
  property will no longer result in the MenuItem losing focus.
  
+ Improved compatibility with Menu CSS and YUI Base CSS.


*** version 2.3 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Pressing the Esc key when an item in a MenuBar has focus will now result
  in the item blurring in IE.

+ Clicking a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance with a "url" configuration property 
  set will now result in the hiding of its parent YAHOO.widget.Menu instance.

+ Creating an empty YAHOO.widget.Menu instance from existing markup will no 
  longer result in a JavaScript error.
  
+ The "constraintoviewport" configuration property now correctly keeps a 
  YAHOO.widget.Menu instance inside the boundaries of the browser viewport.

+ Tuned scrolling behavior so that when the user has scrolled to the bottom of 
  a YAHOO.widget.Menu instance and starts pressing the up arrow key, the 
  contents begin scrolling only when the next item to be selected is out of 
  view of the scrollable area.

+ Modified "removeMenu" method of YAHOO.widget.MenuManager so that it removes
  the specified YAHOO.widget.Menu instance from the collection of visible menus.
 
+ Calling the "destroy" method of a visible YAHOO.widget.Menu instance now
  purges it from the YAHOO.widget.Manager's collection of visible Menus.
 
+ YAHOO.widget.Menu instances now blur before hiding.

+ The debug version of YAHOO.widget.Menu now correctly logs as "Menu" rather 
  than "Overlay" in IE.
  
+ Setting a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance's "checked" configuration property 
  to "true" two or more times followed by "false" will no longer result in some 
  of the DOM elements used to render the checkmark icon will no longer remain 
  in the item's DOM.

+ It is now possible to click anywhere on a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance 
  and have it navigate to the URL specified by its "url" configuration property 
  - even if the MenuItem has a value specified for its "target"
  configuation property.

+ The "toString" method of YAHOO.widget.MenuItem now returns the instance's id.

+ Setting the YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.prototype.COLLAPSED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT 
  constant to empty string no longer results in JavaScript error.

+ YAHOO.widget.MenuBar instances behave the same regardless of the value
  of their "position" configuration property.

+ It is now possible to ctr or shift-click on YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instances 
  without the browser automatically redirecting to the URL specified by the 
  MenuItem's "url" configuration property.


Added the following features:
-----------------------------

+ Prototype of all classes (Menu, ContextMenu, MenuBar, MenuItem, 
  ContextMenuItem, MenuBarItem) are augmented with YAHOO.util.EventProvider.

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.MenuManager:

    - "getMenuItem"
    - "getMenuItemGroup"

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.Menu:

    - "subscribe" 
    - "getSubmenus"
    - "onRender"

+ Added a "disabled" configuration property to YAHOO.widget.Menu.

+ Added the constant "CSS_LABEL_CLASS_NAME" to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem that 
  represents the name of the CSS class applied to the <A/> node that is the 
  first child of its root <LI/> node.

+ Added the constant "CSS_LABEL_CLASS_NAME" to YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem that 
  represents the name of the CSS class applied to the <A/> node that is the 
  first child of its root <LI/> node.

+ Added ability for YAHOO.widget.Menu instances to have shadow:

    - The shadow for a Menu is implemented by appending a new element as the 
      last child of its root <DIV/> element:

        <DIV class="yuimenu">
            <DIV class="bd">
                <UL>
                    <LI class="yuimenuitem"/>
                    <LI class="yuimenuitem"/>
                    <LI class="yuimenuitem"/>
                </UL>
            </DIV>
            <DIV class="yui-menu-shadow"/>
        </DIV>

    - The code that creates the shadow element resides inside the Menu's 
      public "onRender" prototype method.  To disable the creation of a Menu's 
      shadow override the prototype of the "onRender" method:
      
      YAHOO.widget.Menu.prototype.onRender = function () { };
      
    - The actual creation of the shadow element is deferred until the Menu is 
      made visible for the first time.
      
    - The shadow element is only created for Menu instances whose
      "position" configuration property is set to "dynamic."

    - A Menu's shadow element can be styled via two CSS classes:

        + "yui-menu-shadow"  - Applied to the shadow element when it is created.
        + "yui-menu-shadow-visible" - Applied to the shadow element when the 
        Menu is visible; it is removed when hidden.

    - The shadow element is only styled when using the new "Sam" skin, for
      the previous default skin its "display" property is set to "none."


Changes:
--------

+ Deprecated "browser" property of YAHOO.widget.MenuItem in favor 
  of the YAHOO.env.ua.

+ Modified the DOM structure for a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance so that its
  root <LI/> node only has only two direct descendants: 
  
    - The <A/> node for its text label
    - The <DIV/> node for its submenu
  
  The submenu indicator node (<EM class="submenuindicator" />), checked 
  indicator node (<EM class="checkedindicator" />), and help text node
  (<EM class="helptext" />) that were previously direct descendants of a
  YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instance's root <LI/> are now direct descendants of 
  its <A/> node:

    <LI class="yuimenuitem || yuimenubaritem">

        <A class="yuimenuitemlabel || yuimenubaritemlabel">

            Text Label

            <EM class="helptext"> Help Text </EM>   (Optional)
            <EM class="checkedindicator"> ... </EM> (Optional)
            <EM class="submenuindicator"> ... </EM> (Optional)

        </A>

        <DIV class="yuimenu"> ... </DIV> (Optional submenu node)

    </LI>

+ As a result of the DOM structure changes for YAHOO.widget.MenuItem, the
  following CSS class are now only applied to a YAHOO.widget.MenuItem 
  instance's <A/> node:

    - "selected"
    - "disabled"
    - "checked"
    - "hashelptext"
    - "hassubmenu"

+ The "text" configuration property of YAHOO.widget.MenuItem now accepts a 
  string of HTML (previously only accepted plain text).

+ The "emphasis" and "strongemphasis" configuration properties of 
  YAHOO.widget.MenuItem are no longer interpreted when building from 
  existing markup.

+ All YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instances built from markup must have an <A> node 
  as the first child of its root <LI> node.

+ When building YAHOO.widget.MenuItem instances from existing markup, the value 
  of the "text" property is set to the innerHTML of the menu item's <A> node.

+ Deprecated the following YAHOO.widget.MenuItem configuration properties:

    - "strongemphasis"
    - "emphasis"
    - "helptext"


Known Issues
------------

+ ContextMenu works differently in Opera
  --------------------------------------
  Opera doesn't support the "contextmenu" DOM event used to trigger the display
  of YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instances.  As a result, clicking the right mouse 
  button in Opera will not result in the display of a ContextMenu instance 
  as it would in IE, Gecko, and Safari.  To work around this shortcoming, users 
  will need to do the following to trigger the display of 
  YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instances in Opera:

    - Opera for Windows: Hold down the control key while clicking with the 
      left mouse button.

    - Opera for Mac OS X: Hold down the command/Apple key while clicking with  
      the left mouse button.

+ Focus highlight sticks in Opera 
  -------------------------------
  In Opera focus is designated via the application of a background color 
  to an element's text node.  When a Menu instance has focus in Opera, the 
  focus highlight can remain on a MenuItem instance even after it has blurred.

+ ContextMenu instances cannot be invoked by clicking on Java Applets
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  When a Java Applet is specified as the "trigger" element for a ContextMenu 
  instance it will not display when the Applet is clicked.  This is not a 
  bug in the ContextMenu class, but rather a result of DOM events not bubbling 
  up from inside Java Applets.  For more information on this issue see:
  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/12128

+ Flash Movies appear on top of Menu instances
  --------------------------------------------
  Flash movies can appear on top of Menu instances in IE and Gecko-based
  browsers.  To fix this problem, set the "wmode" of the Flash movie to either
  "transparent" or "opaque" as indicated below: 

  Via the <object> tag:

    <object>
        <param name="wmode" value="opaque">
    </object>

    <object>
        <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> 
    </object>

  Via the <embed> tag:
    
    <embed wmode="transparent"> ... </embed>
    <embed wmode="opaque"> ... </embed>

    ** For more information see 
       http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_15523

+ Menu instances not rendered at correct z-index in IE
  -------------------------------------------------------
  In IE, when a Menu instance is rendered inside a relatively positioned 
  element the z-index of the Menu instance is now relative to its 
  relatively positioned parent element.  This is not a bug in the 
  Menu class, but rather a bug in IE where relatively positioned elements 
  establish a new stacking context for their child nodes.  To avoid this 
  bug is recommend that all Menu instances that need to be able to float
  above any other element in the document be made direct descendants of the 
  <body> element.

   http://therealcrisp.xs4all.nl/meuk/IE-zindexbug.html

+ Elements with scrollbars poke through Menu instances floating above them
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There is a bug in Gecko-based browsers for Mac OS X where an element's 
  scrollbars will poke through absolutely positioned elements floating above
  them.  To fix this problem the "overflow" property of a Menu instance's 
  shadow element is toggled between "hidden" and "auto" (through the application 
  and removal of the "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" CSS classes) as its 
  "visibility" configuration property is toggled between "false" and "true."
  Therefore, the shadow element acts like a shim, blocking scrollbars from
  poking through the Menu.

  PLEASE NOTE:  

  1) The "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" CSS classes classes are 
     applied only for Gecko on Mac OS X and are added/removed to/from the 
     Menu's root HTML element (DIV) via the "hideMacGeckoScrollbars" and 
     "showMacGeckoScrollbars" methods of YAHOO.widget.Overlay.  
  
  2) This fix is only applied when using the "Sam" skin; the CSS for the 
     original Menu skin does not contain any rules for rendering the 
     shadow element.  
  
  3) Once the fix is applied the bug will reappear if the window loses focus.  
     This can be fixed via Javascript by hiding and showing the Menu instance 
     when the window receives focus:

        YAHOO.util.Event.on(window, "focus", function () {
        
            oMyMenu.hide();
            oMyMenu.show();
        
        });

*** version 2.2.2 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ "toString" method of MenuItem, MenuBarItem and ContextMenuItem classes will
  no longer throw a JavaScript error when using the debug version 
  of the Event utility.

+ "toString" method of Menu, MenuBar and ContextMenu classes will
  no longer attempt to output the instance's id if it is not available.

+ Logger statements output by debug version of MenuManager are now properly 
  categorized as "MenuManager"



*** version 2.2.1 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.Menu:
  - "focus"
  - "blur"
  - "hasFocus"

+ Added the following Custom Events to YAHOO.widget.Menu:
    + "focusEvent"
    + "blurEvent"

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.MenuManager:
  - "getFocusedMenuItem"
  - "getFocusedMenu"

+ Added "hasFocus" method to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Menu instances no longer set focus to themselves by default when made 
  visible.  Menus only receive focus in response to the following events: 
    - The user mouses down on a MenuItem instance
    - The user tabs into a MenuItem instance

+ Application of the "maxheight" configuration property is now correctly 
  deferred until the "render" event fires when Menu instance is being 
  lazy loaded.

+ The "maxheight" configuration property can now be set multiple times without 
  a Menu instance restoring itself to its original default height.

+ The "maxheight" configuration property can now be set on hidden Menu 
  instances that use lazy loading. 

+ Menu instances with a "width" configuration property set will now render 
  at the specified width rather than shrink wrapping to their contents.

+ Menu item help text no longer wraps to the next line in Opera 9.

+ Immediate submenus of a Menubar instance will no longer shift their position 
  to try and remain inside the confines of the browser's viewport.

+ Lazy loaded ContextMenu instances now appear in the correct position when 
  they are made visible for the first time.

+ MenuBar instances no longer throw JavaScript errors when navigating items with
  submenus containing no active items using the keyboard.

+ Replaced use of native "hasOwnProperty" method 
  with YAHOO.lang.hasOwnProperty.

+ Rendered Menu instances will now update their width when items are added 
  or removed.

+ Mousing over a Menu instance in an IE window that does not have focus will 
  no longer cause the window to receive focus.


Changes:
--------

+ "activeItem" property of YAHOO.widget.Menu now returns a reference to the 
  Menu's currently selected item.

+ Added a "visible" CSS class that is applied to visible Menu instances.

+ Refactored the Menu family to improve performance, especially when working 
  with a large number of instances in IE6.



*** version 2.2.0 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

* Added two new methods to YAHOO.widget.Menu:

    * "getItems" - Returns a flat array of the items in a menu.

    * "clearContent" - Removes all of the content from the menu, including the 
      menu items, group titles, header and footer.


* Added three new configuration attributes to YAHOO.widget.Menu:

    * "submenuhidedelay" - Number indicating the time (in milliseconds) that 
      should expire before a submenu is hidden when the user mouses out of a 
      menu item heading in the direction of a submenu. The value must be 
      greater than or equal to the value specified for the "showdelay" 
      configuration property.

    * "maxheight" - Defines the maximum height (in pixels) for a menu before 
      the contents of the body are scrolled. 

    * "classname" - CSS class to be applied to the menu's root <div> element. 
      The specified class(es) are appended in addition to the default class as 
      specified by the menu's CSS_CLASS_NAME constant.


* Added new constants to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem:

    * COLLAPSED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT - String representing the text for the 
      <em> element used for the submenu arrow indicator.

    * EXPANDED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT - String representing the text for the 
      submenu arrow indicator element (<em>) when the submenu is visible.

    * DISABLED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_ALT_TEXT - String representing the text for 
      the submenu arrow indicator element (<em>) when the menu item is disabled.

    * CHECKED_TEXT - String representing the text to be used for the checked 
      indicator element (<em>).

    * DISABLED_CHECKED_TEXT - String representing the text to be used for the 
      checked indicator element (<em>) when the menu item is disabled.


* Added two new configuration attributes to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem:

    * "onclick" - Object literal representing the code to be executed when the 
      button is clicked. Format:

        {
            fn: Function, // The handler to call when the event fires.
            obj: Object, // An object to pass back to the handler.
            scope: Object // The object to use for the scope of the handler.
        }
    
    * "classname" - CSS class to be applied to the menu item's root <li> 
      element. The specified class(es) are appended in addition to the default 
      class as specified by the menu item's CSS_CLASS_NAME constant.


* Added an "id" property to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem that represents the id of
  the menu item's root <li> node.  Although not a configuration attribute, this
  property should be set via the object literal of configuration attributes 
  passed as the second argument to the constructor.  If no value is 
  specified, then one will be generated using the "generateId" method of the 
  Dom utility (YAHOO.widget.Dom).

* Added a "trigger context menu event" 
  (YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu.triggerContextMenuEvent) that fires when the DOM 
  "contextmenu" event ("mousedown" for Opera) is fired by one of the elemeents
  defined as a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance's trigger.

* Added a "cancel" method to YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu that can be used to 
  cancel the display of a YAHOO.widget.ContextMen instance.  This method 
  should be called within the scope of a "context menu" event handler for 
  one of the context menu's triggers 
  (YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu.triggerContextMenuEvent).


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Users can now move diagonally from a menu item to its corresponding submenu 
  without the submenu hiding immediately.

* "destroy" method of YAHOO.widget.Menu now unsubscribes from the "text resize"  
  event (YAHOO.widget.Module.textResizeEvent).

* Browser progress bar no longer flashes when hovering over checked menu items

* No changes



*** version 0.12.1 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Placed the call to the DOM "focus" method used by the MenuItem class inside 
  a zero-second timeout to resolve a race condition between menu positioning 
  and focusing of a menu item that resulted in the browser viewport 
  scrolling unnecessarily.

* Switched to JSMin for JavaScript compression to resolve issues with the 
  minified version.  

* Disabled menu item instances will no longer display a submenu if the item is 
  clicked or moused over.

  mouse simultaneously.

      hidden if the user clicks outside of it.

    * "autosubmenudisplay" - Boolean indicating if submenus are automatically 
      made visible when the user mouses over the menu's items.

* Added a "toString" method to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem, YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem 
  and YAHOO.widget.ContextMenuItem that returns the class name followed by the 
  value of the item's "text" configuration property.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Setting a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance's "trigger" configuration 
  property will remove all previous triggers before setting up the new ones.

  entire menu.

Changes:
--------

  classes.  The Base classes are now YAHOO.widget.Menu and 
  YAHOO.widget.MenuItem.

* "addItem" and "insertItem" methods of YAHOO.widget.Menu now accept an

    * Object literal representation of a menu
    * Element id
    * Element reference

* "hide" and "show" methods of statically positioned menus now toggle the their
  element's "display" style property between "block" and "none."



*** version 0.10.0 ***

* Initial release

* Known issues:

      * Some Firefox extensions disable the ability for JavaScript to prevent  
        the display of the browser's default context menu.  These extensions
        can cause the YUI ContextMenu to stop working.  If you encounter this 
        problem, you can reset the context menu preference in Firefox back to 
        the default by making sure the "Disable or replace context menus" 
        preference is checked:

            Mac Firefox 1.0: 
            -------------------
            Preferences > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Mac Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Preferences > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.0
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus



*** version 0.11.3 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

* Added a "target" configuration property to the MenuModuleItem object that
  allows the user to specify the target of an item's anchor element.  Items 
  that make use of the "target" configuration property will require the user 
  to click exactly on the item's anchor element to navigate to the specified 
  URL.

* Items without a "url" property set will automatically hide their parent 
  menu instance(s) when clicked.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Items in a submenu should now navigate to their specified URL when clicked.

* Removed MenuBar's use of "overflow:hidden."  This fixes an issue in Firefox
  1.5 in which submenus of a Menubar instance cannot overlay other absolutely 
  positioned elements on the page.

* Submenus of a Menubar instance will now automatically have their iframe shim
  enabled in IE<7.

* Statically positioned Menubar and Menu instances will now render with the 
  correct position and dimensions in Safari.

* MenuModuleItem's "focus" method now checks to make sure that an item's 
  "display" style property is not "none" before trying to set focus to its
  anchor element.
  
* A ContextMenu instance will now hide all other ContextMenu instances before
  displaying itself.

* Removed the dead space in front of an item's submenu indicator image in IE.  
  This space was causing an item's submenu to flicker when the user hovered 
  over it.


Changes:
--------

* Moved the DOM event handlers for every menu from the root DIV node of each 
  instance to the document object.  This change reduces the number of DOM event 
  handlers used by Menu to eight, improving the cleanup time required by the 
  Event utility.

                

*** version 0.11.0 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------
* Overloaded the "addItem" and "insertItem" methods of MenuModule to accept a 
  string or a MenuModuleItem instance

* Added the ability to define a MenuItem instance as being "checked"


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------
* Changing the path for the submenu indicator image of one MenuModuleItem 
  subclass will no longer affect other subclasses

* MenuItem instances built from existing markup without anchor tags will no 
  longer trigger a JavaScript error when clicked

* Modified the implementation of the "imageRoot" property for the 
  MenuModuleItem class so that it is set to a secure/non-secure path when the
  object is instantiated

* Menu instances now resize in response to changes to the browser's font size

* Modified the propagation of the MenuModule class's "submenualignment" 
  configuration property so that it only applies to instances of the same type

* Adjusted the specificity of the style rule that controls the position of a 
  MenuItem instance's submenu indicator image to prevent it from wrapping in IE

* Specified a width and height for submenu indicator images in the Menu 
  stylesheet to ensure that Menu instances are always rendered at the correct 
  width

* Clicking a MenuItem instance will no longer trigger two HTTP GET requests

* Users can now control or shift-click on MenuItem links


Changes:
--------
* In the Menu stylesheet (menu.css), switched from using "first" class to
  "first-of-type" class

* Changed case of MenuModuleItem class's "subMenuIndicator" property 
  to "submenuIndicator"
