utilities.js Release Notes

*** version 0.12.1 ***

  * Includes 0.12.1 revisions to all YUI utilities and includes yahoo.js.

*** version 0.12.0 ***

The utilities.js file rolls up all of the YUI utility components into a single
file; it includes the following components:

* Yahoo Global Object
* Event
* Dom
* Connection Manager
* Animation
* Drag & Drop

For implementations that use a significant subset of these files, it may prove
more efficient to include utilities.js as opposed to including separate files
for each component.

Note: If you are require only the Yahoo Global Object, Event Utility and Dom
collection, consider using the special yahoo-event-dom.js aggregate instead.
