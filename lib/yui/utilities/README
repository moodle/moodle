utilities.js Release Notes

*** NOTE ***

This document is not updated with each release.  Changes to
the utilities.js source are noted in the README
file for each component that comprises this aggregate:

yahoo/README
dom/README
event/README
connection/README
animation/README
dragdrop/README

************

*** version 0.12.0 ***

The utilities.js file rolls up all of the YUI utility components into a single
file; it includes the following components:

* Yahoo Global Object
* Event
* Dom
* Connection Manager
* Animation
* Drag & Drop

For implementations that use a significant subset of these files, it may prove
more efficient to include utilities.js as opposed to including separate files
for each component.

Note: If you are require only the Yahoo Global Object, Event Utility and Dom
collection, consider using the special yahoo-event-dom.js aggregate instead.
