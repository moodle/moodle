YUI Library - Grids - Release Notes

Version 0.12.1 - 0.12.2

  * No changes.

Version 0.12.0

  * Removed redundant "text-align:left" from nodes below #doc.

  * Removed small-font treatment on #ft.

  * Removed margin-bottom from #hd,#bd.

  * Added two new #doc definitions (#doc2 and #doc3) that provide 
    950px centered and 100% page width presets to supplement the 
    original 750px centered page width.

  * Made ".first" selectors more precise by binding to divs, to 
    make it less likely that our .first definitions will impact 
    nested content elements wishing to use this nomenclature.

  * Fixed "nested yui-gc" bug.

  * Fixed build-process whitespace bug with .yui-t2 and .yui-t5.

  * Migrated .yui-t's technique to "negative margins" technique 
    from "floated ems".

  * The "negative margins" technique caused z-index issues, so 
    position:relative was added to the secondary yui-b to enable 
	correct z-index.

  * Make optimization benefits from inheritence wins via code 
    reorganizations.

Version 0.11.0

  * Removed line #43 because it set an already-set value.
    Was: ".yui-t7  #main .yui-b{min-width:750px;}"
  
Version 0.10.0

  * Initial release.
