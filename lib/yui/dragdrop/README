Drag and Drop Release Notes

2.3.0
  * YAHOO.util.DragDropMgr.stopDrag is now public, and can be used to cancel
    a drag in progress.  An optional "silent" flag was added to skip the
    onMouseUp and endDrag functions when needed (eliminating the need to
    supply mouseup page coordinates to these functions).
  * DDProxy: the position of the proxy is not set before the drag is confirmed,
    preventing auto-scroll from distrupting the user experience.
  * Modified the default proxy so that IE properly registers the proxy as
    the event target during the drag.
  * If a dd instance is created using a dom reference rather than an id, that
    reference is stored and used throughout making it possible to control
    instances outside the current window.
  * The document mousemove listener no longer returns true.

2.2.2
  * No change

2.2.1

  * Added YAHOO.util.DragDropMgr.interactionInfo, which is
    a repository of interaction information accumulated during
    the current event loop result, and accessible from the
    handlers for the events.
  * The region for the dragged element is now cached while
    processing the drag and drop events
  * List example supports moving an item to an empty list
  * Fixed missing html tags in the examples
  * The debug version now works when included before the logger is included.

2.2.0

  * onMouseDown event is executed before element positions are calculated
  * refreshCache refreshes everything if groups array is not provided
  * setX/setYConstraint doesn't fail when presented ints cast as strings

0.12.2

  * No change

0.12.1

  * Added a STRICT_INTERSECT drag and drop interaction mode.  This alters the
    behavior of DDM::getBestMatch.  INTERSECT mode first tests the cursor
    location, and if it is over the target that target wins, otherwise it
    tests the overlap of the elements.  STRICT_INTERSECT mode tests only 
    the overlap, the largest overlap wins.

  * getBestMatch will work for targeted elements that have no overlap.

0.12.0

   * The logic to determine if a drag should be initiated has been isolated
     to the clickValidator method.  This method can be overridden to provide
     custom valdiation logic.  For example, it is possible to specify hotspots
     of any dimension or shape.  The provided example shows how to make only
     a circular region in the middle of the element initiate a drag.

   * Added a new drag and drop event: onInvalidDrop.  This is executed when
     the dragged element in dropped in a location without a target.  Previously
     this condition could only detected by implementing handlers for three 
     other events.

   * Now accepts an element reference in lieu of an id.  Ids will
     be generated if the element does not have one.

   * Fixed horizontal autoscroll when scrollTop is zero.

   * Added hasOuterHandles property to bypass the isOverTarget check in the
     mousedown validation routine.  Fixes setOuterHandleElId.

0.11.4

   * YAHOO.util.DragDropMgr.swapNode now handles adjacent nodes properly
   
   * Fixed missing variable declarations

0.11.3
 
   * Fixed a JavaScript error that would be generated when trying to implement
     DDProxy using the default settings and a tiny element.

   * Fixed an error that resulted when constraints were applied to DragDrop 
     instances.

0.11.2

   * Drag and drop will no longer interfere with selecting text on elements
     that are not involved in drag and drop.

   * The shared drag and drop proxy element now resizes correctly when autoResize
     is enabled.

0.11.1

   * Fixes an issue where the setXY cache could get out of sync if the element's
     offsetParent is changed during onDragDrop.

0.11.0

   * The Dom.util.setXY calculation for the initial placement of the dragged
     element is cached during the drag, enhancing the drag performance.

   * DDProxy no longer enforces having a single proxy element for all instances.
     dragElId can be set in the config object in the constructor.  If the
     element already exists it will use that element, otherwise a new one will
     be created with that id.

   * DDProxy->borderWidth has been removed. The value is calculated on the fly
     instead.

   * Added DragDrop->clearTicks and DragDrop->clearConstraints

   * All drag and drop constructors now have an additional, optional parameter
     call "config".  It is an object that can contain properties for a
     number of configuration settings.

   * Drag and drop will not be disabled for elements that cannot have their
     location determined.

   * isLegalTarget won't return dd objects that are not targetable.

   * Added DragDrop->removeFromGroup.

   * Constraints are now applied properly when determining which drag and drop
     events should fire.


0.10.0

   * Improved the performance when in intersect mode

   * It was possible for the drag and drop initialization to be skipped
     for very slow loading pages.  This was fixed.

   * New methods to exclude regions within your drag and drop element: 
     addInvalidHandleId(), addInvalidHandleClass()

   * Added an onAvailable handler that is executed after the initial state is set.

   * Drag and drop is more forgiving when the implementer attempts to create the
     instance prior to the element being in the document, but after the window
     load event has fired.
