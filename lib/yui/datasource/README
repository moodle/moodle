DataSource Release Notes

**** version 2.3.0 ****

* DataSource requests over XHR no longer automatically insert a "?" in the URIs
between the host and the query. Implementers should explicitly include the
question mark if it is required by your server. Please refer to the DataTable XHR
examples for implementation details.

* DataSource provides the following static type conversion methods:
DataSource.parseDate(), DataSource.parseNumber(), and DataSource.parseString().
These are executed in the scope of the DataSource instance.

* DataSource now supports the following values for the property xhrConnMode:
    "queueRequests"
    "allowAll"
    "cancelStaleRequests"
    "ignoreStaleResponses"




**** version 2.2.2 ***

* No changes.
