Container Release Notes

*** version 0.12.2 ***

	Module
	   - Corrected issue where listener was not properly removed from resize monitor element when "monitorresize" is disabled

	Panel
	   - Fixed issue that would sometimes prevent select lists from working properly in Firefox
	
	Dialog
	   - Fixed error that would occur when trying to create a Dialog where the first form element is set to "disabled"
	   - Modified "close" property handler for Dialog/SimpleDialog to call "cancel" instead of "hide"

*** version 0.12.1 ***

	All Classes
	   - "monitorresize" property now functions in situations where document.domain has been modified.
	   - YAHOO.widget.Module.textResizeEvent now fires when the font size is changed (except for Opera, which uses "zoom" functionality that prevents this)
	   - Event listeners attached to container elements are now properly purged on destroy using YAHOO.util.Event.purgeElement

	Panel
	   - Fixed issue where focus events were broken on the page when a modal Panel was created

	Dialog
	   - Fixed bug where hitting "enter" on a Dialog was forcing the default submission behavior of the form's action to execute
	   - Dialog no longer tries to give focus to hidden form elements.
	   - Replaced &nbsp; references in Panel with &#160; for XHTML compliance.
	   - Fixed issue that was preventing Safari from successfully using the getData() function

*** version 0.12 ***

	All Classes
	   - New documentation format implemented, and removed unnecessary prototype null references previously used for generating documentation

	Config
	   - Added 'undefined' check when reading initial properties for .reset() 
	   - Fixed Firefox warning on .resetProperty()
	   - Fixed issue preventing resetProperty() from resetting values correctly

	Module
	   - Removed unused "childNodesInDom" property

	Overlay
	   - Converted center() to use Dom utility
	   - Fixed configVisible() to properly detect actual visible/hidden status in Internet Explorer, which reports "inherit" for all elements by default.
	   - Updated onDomResize to properly reapply "context" property
	   - Unified scroll/resize handlers so that they fire properly (when the event has completed) as opposed to constantly (as seen in Mozilla-based browsers)
		
	Panel
	   - Modified modality mask to show before Panel is shown (prior to any animation)
	   - Modified buildWrapper to eliminate cloning of the initial markup module, which fixes issues with select options not maintaining their default selections in IE
	   - Modality mask is now z-indexed properly so that the mask z-index is always one less than the Panel z-index
		
	Dialog
	   - Fixed Connection to get "action" attribute using getAttribute, to allow for form fields named "action"
	   - Added support for "GET" by retrieving the form "method" rather than always defaulting to "POST"
		
	KeyListener
	   - Fixed to work properly with Safari 2.0 by matching against keyCode or charCode
