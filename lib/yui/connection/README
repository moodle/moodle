Connection Manager Release Notes

*** version 0.11.0 ***

* Each transactions can be defined with a timeout threshold, in milliseconds,
through the callback object.  If the threshold is reached, and the transaction
hasn't completed, the transaction will call abort().

* abort() will now accept a callback object as the second argument.  The
failure callback will receive a response object to indicate the transaction was
aborted.

* setForm() will now support file uploads by setting the second argument to
true (e.g., YAHOO.util.Connect.setForm(formObject, true).  File upload does not
use the callback success or failure handler.  Instead, it uses a new callback
object handler: upload.

* HTML form submit will no longer submit form fields without a defined name
attribute.

* The default POST header of 'Content-Type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
can be overridden by calling setDefaultPostHeader(false).  This
will remove the default header from non-HTML form, POST submissions.

* setHeader() now enumerates through the _http_header object with
propertyIsEnumerable to prevent collisions with members added to Object via
prototype.

*** version 0.10.0 ***

* handleTransactionResponse() now treats the full HTTP 2xx range as a success
case, instead of just HTTP 200.

* To accommodate multiple field values in Mozilla/Firefox, multiple initHeader
calls with the same label will now result in the values concatenated to a
comma- delimited string value.
Example:
Setting Content-Type:'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and Content-
Type:'text/xml' will result in Content-Type:'application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
text/xml'.

* Default polling interval lowered to 50ms.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.setPollingInterval() will allow you to set a polling
interval -- in milliseconds -- to override the default value.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.getResponseHeader[headerLabel] now supported as a response
object property to provide symmetry with the native XHR object's property.
Example:
YAHOO.util.Connect.getResponseHeader['Content-Length'] will return the value
for the Content-Length header, if the header is available.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.allResponseHeaders property renamed to
getAllResponseHeaders to provide symmetry with the native XHR object's
property.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.setForm() now supports HTTP GET as well as HTTP POST.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.setForm() now accepts an HTML form object as well as its
name attribute value.

* YAHOO.util.Connect.setForm() will not submit HTML form fields that are
disabled or do not have a name attribute value.

* [FIXED] Response exceptions result in infinite callback loop in
Mozilla/Firefox.

* [FIXED] YAHOO.util.Connect.abort() now properly clears polling interval.

* [FIXED] isCallInProgress() now verifies whether XHR instance still exists,
and returns false if the connection object is no longer available.
