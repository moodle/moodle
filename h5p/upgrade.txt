This file has been replaced by UPGRADING.md. See MDL-81125 for further information.

This files describes API changes in core libraries and APIs,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.4 ===
* Added new methods, 'generate_custom_styles' and 'get_custom_styles' to 'core_h5p\file_storage' to generate then
provide a CSS file to be used by the 'core_h5p\output\renderer\h5p_alter_styles' method, reference:
(https://h5p.org/documentation/for-developers/visual-changes) when there is custom CSS in the 'core_h5p\h5pcustomcss'
setting.  This will then apply to the H5P content.

=== 4.3 ===
* The `\core_h5p\file_storage::EDITOR_FILEAREA` constant has been removed, as all editor files are stored in user draft

=== 4.0 ===
* Added new methods to api: get_original_content_from_pluginfile_url and can_edit_content.
* Added edit.php and editcontent_form class, for modifying H5P content given an H5P identifier (from the h5p table).
* Added a new parameter to the player::display method, to define whether the edit button should be displayed below the
H5P content or not. Default value for this parameter is false.
* H5P subsystem is allowed to act as an API (level 2) too.
* Plugins can now implement h5p\canedit::can_edit_content method to define, if required, any custom behaviour for deciding
whether an H5P content can be edited or not. The specific plugin check will completely override the generic check.
* The third-party library h5p/h5plib/v124/core has been updated to version 1.24.3.

=== 3.11 ===
* Added $skipcapcheck parameter to H5P constructor, api::create_content_from_pluginfile_url() and
api::get_content_from_pluginfile_url() to let skip capabilities check to get the pluginfile URL.
* Added new field "enabled" to h5p_libraries to let define if a content type is enabled (1) or not (0).
For now, only runnable content-types can be disabled/enabled. When a content-type is disabled, their
contents are not displayed and no new contents using it can be created/uploaded.
Some extra methods have been added to the api too in order to support this field:
- set_library_enabled
- is_library_enabled
- is_valid_package
* The third-party library h5p/h5plib/v124/core has been updated to version 1.24.2.

=== 3.10 ===
* Added a new cache for h5p_library_files (MDL-69207)

=== 3.9 ===
* A new plugintype has been created, h5plib, for having installed more
than one H5P library version.
* H5P third-party libraries have been moved from /lib/h5p to h5p/h5plib/v124,
as an h5plib plugintype.
* H5P Editor PHP library added to h5plib v124 plugin.
