# Brute force protection full audit report

## Environment analysis
- Moodle core: version 4.5.2+ (Build: 20250227). Base system inspected: authentication flows, roles/capabilities, logging, scheduled tasks and caching follow standard core behavior. No overrides found.
- Authentication: core login uses `пала` events `user_login_failed` and `user_loggedin`. Plugin must hook into these events.
- Roles: standard roles (admin, manager, teacher, student). Administrators must never be blocked inadvertently.
- Logging: moodle uses events/mdl_logstore_standard. Plugin's own tables integrate with DB API.
- Scheduled tasks: handled via `core\task\scheduled_task` API. Caches must be invalidated via `cache_helper` when necessary.

## Initial plugin assessment (`tool_bruteforce`)
- Present features:
  - Records login attempts and maintains basic user/IP blocks with daily IP limit.
  - Minimal admin page showing active blocks.
  - CLI scripts to purge blocks, list blocks and import/export lists.
  - API wrapper (`classes/api.php`), scheduled task for purging, settings with thresholds, basic whitelist/blacklist management.
- Missing / deficient:
  - XMLDB definitions triggered installation errors (`Invalid TYPE attribute`, `Problem loading key userix`).
  - Whitelist/blacklist lacked CIDR support and CLI management, and privileged role exemptions were incomplete.
  - API lacks CIDR matching and manual unblocking audit trail.
  - No extended notifications, dashboard, or comprehensive tests.

## Changes in this iteration
- Fixed XMLDB schema indexes to avoid installation errors and ensure valid definitions.
- Added capability `tool/bruteforce:exempt` and observer checks to protect privileged roles from automatic blocking.
- Extended whitelist/blacklist system:
  - Validation now accepts IPv4/IPv6 ranges (CIDR) and correct IP validators.
  - API supports CIDR matching and helper functions for IP range comparison.
  - Introduced CLI script `manage_list.php` for adding, deleting and listing entries.
- Updated language strings for CLI messages and exemption capability.
- Added unit tests for CIDR handling.
- Converted log table indexes to XMLDB `KEY` elements and expanded audit table schema (actor, target, reason) for installation stability.
- Implemented manual unblock capability via UI and CLI with audit logging of actor, target and reason.

## Pending work (high level)
- Implement notifications, dashboard, extended CLI operations, scheduled metrics, tests, and hardening.

(partially addressed: schema fix, CIDR support, CLI management, privilege exemption)

## Residual risks
- Notifications, dashboard metrics and extended hardening remain absent, leaving monitoring gaps and potential race conditions.

## Required test cases
- Installation of plugin with clean database.
- Adding/removing list entries via UI and CLI.
- CIDR-based entries respected on login attempts.
- Privileged users (admins/managers) never blocked.
- Manual unblock logs audit entry and removes block.

## Implementation notes (current iteration)
- Commit: *feat: add audit logging and manual unblock*
- Manual test: install plugin, create a block then navigate to the brute force dashboard and use the **Unblock** action; confirm the block is removed and an entry is written in *tool_bruteforce_audit*.
- Automated test: `vendor/bin/phpunit admin/tool/bruteforce/tests/api_test.php`
