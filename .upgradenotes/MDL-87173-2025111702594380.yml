    - message: >-
        The CLI script used to terminate user sessions (kill_all_sessions.php)
        has been improved to make it safer and more flexible. 
        A new '--run' parameter has been introduced. Without '--run', the script performs a dry run making no changes.
        The script now supports targeted session termination using '--for-users' parameter.
      type: improved
