issueNumber: MDL-82747
notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        The Moodle autoloader should now be registered using
        `\core\component::register_autoloader` rather than manually doing so in
        any exceptional location which requires it.

        Note: It is not normally necessary to include the autoloader manually,
        as it is registered automatically when the Moodle environment is bootstrapped.
      type: improved
