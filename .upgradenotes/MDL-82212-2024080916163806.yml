  core:
    - message: >-
        A new method, `\core\output\::get_deprecated_icons()`, has been added
        to the `icon_system` class. All deprecated icons should be registered through this method.

        Plugins can implement a callback to `pluginname_get_deprecated_icons()` to
        register their deprecated icons too.

        When `$CFG->debugpageinfo` is enabled, a console message will display a
        list of the deprecated icons.
