        The `arg_separator.output` has been changed from a default of `amp;` to
        a default of `&` in line with PHP defaults.


        If you were previously relying on the legacy default when using

        `http_build_query()` then you should _actively_ specify the value as the
        third

        parameter, for example:


        ```

        http_build_query($formdata, '', '&amp;');

        ```
      type: changed
