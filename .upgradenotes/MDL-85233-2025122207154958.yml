notes:
  core_filters:
    - message: >-
        MimeTeX support has been removed from both `filter_tex` and
        `filter_algebra`. These filters now depend on LaTeX tools (`latex`,
        `dvips`, and `convert`/`dvisvgm`), and as a result, the `pathmimetex`
        setting has been removed.
      type: removed
