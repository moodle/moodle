  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        Two new public static methods have been added to the `overviewtable`
        class:
        - `is_cm_displayable`: Determines if a course module should be listed in the overview table.
        - `is_cm_available`: Checks if a course module is accessible to the user (and should therefore be rendered as a link).
      type: changed
