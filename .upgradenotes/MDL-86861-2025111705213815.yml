issueNumber: MDL-86861
notes:
  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        Added the `set_visibility` method to the `core_courseformat\sectionactions` class.
        To optimize performance, this method does not return the list of affected resources,
        avoiding unnecessary database queries since the return value is unused.
      type: improved
