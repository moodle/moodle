    - message: >-
        Added several hooks to the restore process to 1) Hook to allow extra settings to be defined for the course
        restore process. 2) Hook to allow adding extra fields to the copy course form. 3) Hook used by
        copy_helper::process_formdata() to expand the list of required fields. 4) Hook used to allow interaction with
        the copy task, before the actual task execution takes place.
        
        Other changes include 1) base_task::add_setting() is now public to allow hook callbacks to add settings.
        2) Settings are now added to the data sent to the course_restored event.
