notes:
  core_grades:
    - message: >-
        In Moodle 4.2, the legacy Gradebook base widget from 4.1 has been removed and
        replaced with a simpler class-based system due to a breaking change and
        excessive complexity in the old pattern. The files `core/grades/basewidget.js` and
        templates in `grade/templates/searchwidget/` have been deleted,
        with minimal expected third-party impact.
      type: removed
