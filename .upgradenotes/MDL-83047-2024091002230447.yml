notes:
  theme_boost:
    - message: >+
        The `.page-header-headings` CSS class now has a background colour
        applied to the maintenance and secure layouts.

        You may need to override this class in your maintenance and secure
        layouts if both of the following are true:

        - Your theme plugin inherits from `theme_boost` and uses this CSS class

        - Your theme plugin applies a different styling for the page header for
        the maintenance and secure layouts.
