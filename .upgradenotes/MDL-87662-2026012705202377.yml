issueNumber: MDL-87662
notes:
  theme:
    - message: >-
        The manual completion button has been moved to the activity header
        to improve visibility and proximity to the activity name. A new
        theme layout option, `completioninheader`, has been introduced to
        control this behaviour and is enabled by default. Themes that set
        completioninheader to false must manually override the relevant
        template (such as `activity_header` or `activity_info`) to ensure
        the completion information is displayed correctly.
      type: improved
