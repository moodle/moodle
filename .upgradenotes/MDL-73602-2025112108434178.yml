issueNumber: MDL-73602
notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        Removed `qtype_random` from core.
        `core\component::is_valid_plugin_name` has an additional check to ensure no-one can create a new plugin called qtype_random,
        as this would conflict with the support for restoring old backups.
      type: removed
