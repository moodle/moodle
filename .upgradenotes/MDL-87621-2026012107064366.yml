  mod_subsection:
    - message: >-
        A new ad-hoc task, `remove_existing_descriptions`, has been added. This
        task will remove the descriptions for all existing subsection instances.
        To ensure system stability, the task processes records in batches of 100
        and clears the original description upon completion.
