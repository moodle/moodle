      # For simplicity in this setup, we assume nginx config handles the proxying 
      # and we might need to share the root if nginx serves static files directly.
      # In a strict prod setup, we'd copy static files to nginx or use a shared volume.
      # Here we'll use a named volume shared between them for simplicity if needed, 
      # OR just rely on the fact that the code is in the moodle container 
      # and nginx might need access to it for static files.
      # A common pattern is to have a shared volume for code or copy code to both.
      # Let's use a shared volume for the code to ensure nginx sees the static files.
