This file describes API changes in /reportbuilder/*
Information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.3 ===

* New external methods for retrieving system report data:
  - `core_reportbuilder_can_view_system_report`
  - `core_reportbuilder_retrieve_system_report`
* New `get_tag_joins_for_entity` helper in base entity class, for returning SQL joins necessary for retrieving tags
* New methods `[set|has]_table_join_alias` in the base entity class, to allow entities to reduce joins on the same table
* New `set_is_deprecated` method in base `local\report\[column|filter]` classes to deprecate report entity columns and filters
* The following report entity columns have been deprecated, with replacements as follows:
  - `comment:context` => `context:name`
  - `comment:contexturl` => `context:link`
  - `enrolment:method` => `enrol:name` (plus enrolment formatter `enrolment_name` method)
  - 'enrolment:role` => `role:name`
  - `file:context` => `context:name`
  - `file:contexturl` => `context:link`
  - `instance:context` (tag) => `context:name`
  - `instance:contexturl` (tag) => `context:link`
* The following report entity filters/conditions have been deprecated, with replacements as follows:
  - `enrolment:method` => `enrol:plugin`
* The `local/audience/form` template outer region has renamed some of it's `data-` attributes (relevant for any themes that
  have overridden this template):
  - `data-instanceid` => `data-audience-id`
  - `data-title` => `data-audience-title`
* The `add_base_condition_sql` method of the base report class will now ignore empty where clauses
* If a non-default column is specified in a datasource `get_default_column_sorting` method, a coding exception will be thrown
* Trying to add/annotate duplicate entity names to a report will now throw a coding exception
* The `get_default_entity_name` method of the base entity class is now private, and shouldn't be overridden in extending classes
* The report helper methods `add_report_[condition|filter]` now throw an exception when trying to add duplicate conditions or
  filters to a report
* Two new methods:
  - `get_default_no_results_notice` and
  - `set_default_no_results_notice`
  have been added to core_reportbuilder\local\report\base, allowing report implementations to control what lang string is used in
  the notice when the report has no results. Reports can either set a preferred lang string, or pass null if the notice isn't
  required in that particular report.

=== 4.2 ===

* New method `set_checkbox_toggleall` in system report class to allow reports to easily create checkbox toggle columns
* Column callbacks are now passed a fourth argument to indicate the aggregation type currently being applied, which allows
  for columns to define how the aggregated data is displayed
* New methods `[add|get]_attributes` added to report base class, for including custom attributes in report container HTML
* New database helper method `sql_replace_parameter_names` to help ensure uniqueness of parameters within an expression (where
  that expression can be used multiple times as part of a larger query)
* The local report filter class has a new `get_field_sql_and_params` method which should be used by filter types that re-use
  the filter field SQL within their generated expression, to ensure SQL containing parameters works correctly
* The following attributes can be added to custom reports in order to control card view display (via the `add_attributes` method):
  - `data-force-card` to force cards view
  - `data-force-table` to force table view
* New optional parameter `pagesize` in external method `core_reportbuilder_reports_get` to set the displayed rows per page.
* Javascript reports repository module method `getReport` updated to accept new pagesize parameter.
* The schedule helper `create_schedule` method accepts a `$timenow` parameter to use for comparisons against current date
  during tests
* The `datasource_stress_test_columns` test helper now enables sorting on those columns that support it
* The `create_[column|filter|condition]` test generator methods now allow for setting all persistent properties
* The `get_category` method of the base audience class has been deprecated, callers should instead use `get_component_displayname`

=== 4.1 ===

* New method `add_action_divider()` in base system report class, to allow adding a divider to the action menu.
* New external method `core_reportbuilder_set_filters` for setting report filter values (plus `setFilters` AJAX repository
  export for calling from Javascript modules)
* New method `set_filter_form_default` in base system report class, to override whether the default filters form
  should be shown for a report
* The external `core_reportbuilder_filters_reset` method now accepts an optional `parameters` argument, required by
  some system reports
* New external methods for retrieving custom report data:
  - `core_reportbuilder_list_reports`
  - `core_reportbuilder_retrieve_report`
  - `core_reportbuilder_view_report`
* For consistency, the following entity classes have moved namespace (usage of previous namespace will generate debugging):
  - `core_admin\{ => reportbuilder}\local\entities\task_log`
  - `core_cohort\{ => reportbuilder}\local\entities\cohort`
  - `core_cohort\{ => reportbuilder}\local\entities\cohort_member`
  - `core_course\{ => reportbuilder}\local\entities\course_category`
  - `report_configlog\{ => reportbuilder}\local\entities\config_change`
* 'set_default_per_page' and 'get_default_per_page' methods have been added to \local\report\base class
  to manage the default displayed rows per page.
* Added two new methods in the datasource class:
  - add_all_from_entity() to add all columns/filters/conditions from the given entity to the report at once
  - add_all_from_entities() to add all columns/filters/conditions from all the entities added to the report at once
* New database helper methods for generating multiple unique values: `generate_aliases` and `generate_param_names`
* The base aggregation `format_value` method has a `$columntype` argument in order to preserve type during aggregation. When
  defining column callbacks, strict typing will now be preserved in your callback methods when the column is being aggregated
* The method `get_joins()` in the base entity class is now public, allowing for easier joins within reports
* New method `set_table_aliases` in base entity class, for overriding multiple table aliases in a single call
* The following local helper methods have been deprecated, their implementation moved to exporters:
  - `audience::get_all_audiences_menu_types` -> `custom_report_audience_cards_exporter`
  - `report::get_available_columns` -> `custom_report_column_cards_exporter`
* The `custom_report_exporter` class now defines its editor element properties as optional, rather than each of those exporters
  defining their own properties as optional. In turn, this means the structure of the following external methods will always be
  present and consistent:
  - `core_reportbuilder_columns_*`
  - `core_reportbuilder_conditions_*`
  - `core_reportbuilder_filters_*`
* The `custom_report_*` exporters now accept only classes that extend datasource as part of their related data properties
* The following permission methods now accept an optional `$context` parameter (default system context):
  - `[require_]can_view_reports_list`
  - `[require_]can_create_report`
* New method `get_default_condition_values()` in base datasource class, to be overridden by sources that wish to
  define default values for conditions upon report creation.
* New methods `get_identity_[column|filter]` in user entity, for retrieving user identity field report elements
* New method `user_reports_list_access_sql` in audience helper for retrieving list of all reports for given user
* New report filter types:
  - `category` for reports containing course categories
  - `tags` for reports containing entities with support for core_tag API
  - `autocomplete` for reports that contain pre-defined values for selection.
* New method `get_sample_values()` added to base filter class, to be overridden in all filter types to support stress testing
* New test helpers for automated stress testing of report sources:
  - `datasource_stress_test_columns`
  - `datasource_stress_test_columns_aggregation`
  - `datasource_stress_test_conditions`
* The test helper method `get_custom_report_content()` now accepts a list of filter values and applies them to the report
* New method `get_default_column_sorting` in base datasource class, to be overridden by sources that wish to
  define default columns sort order upon report creation.
