2002-10-18 Friday 17:09  moodler

	* lib/weblib.php: 
	
	OK, I've rationalised the text formatting now.	Basically, both
	Moodle and HTML text allow the same range of HTML tags (so it
	doesn't matter is you switch from one to the other).
	
	<IMG> and <A> are now ALLOWED in Moodle text.  However, the
	clean_text function now checks for and removes any embedded
	javascript triggers to avoid cross-site scripting attacks that way.
	
	clean_text() should be called on ANY text that comes in from
	students.

	Default language for users is now the same as the site language.

2002-10-18 Friday 14:05  moodler

	* lib/: languages.php, moodlelib.php, weblib.php: 
	
	Allow <IMG> tags in Moodle format text.  Not having it can really
	mess up smileys etc if the text has been edited at any stage using
	the richtext editor.
	
	I realise it's possible for students to really mess up forums
	display etc if they wanted to include a huge picture ... I'm not
	sure if there are any cross-site scripting attacks possible with
	images in there.
	
	But there is also now the HTML format for most things, which is
	editable using an ordinary form, so this problem is currently
	already exposed.
	
	I think it's OK as long as can find a filter to strip all
	javascript out of ANY format text in Moodle.

2002-10-18 Friday 13:41  moodler

	***NOTE NOTE NOTE
	**********************************************************
	
	THIS IS A BIG CHANGE!
	
	I've renamed the "reading" module to "resource".
	
	This meant changing quite a few references throughout Moodle.
	
	The automatic upgrade process should work OK (it worked OK on my
	development server) and there shouldn't be any problems.
	
	BUT PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND KEEP BACKUPS OF EVERYTHING
	UNTIL I HAVE A FEW MORE TESTS!	 If you upgrade please let me know.
	
	One thing that will break are any hard-coded links within forum
	messages.
	
	What I will be doing to fix this on my apache server is to add this
	to httpd.conf:
	
	Redirect /mod/reading/ http://moodle.com/mod/resource/
	
	Sorry about any inconvenience, but it's better this is done sooner
	than later.

	Really, it's usable as long as you don't mind using the database

	Moodle forms (forums, readings, journals etc).	Works only on IE
	5.5 and later.
	
	Slightly customised for a slimmer toolbar.

	* lib/ipatlas/plot.inc: 
	
	Arg .. so much for quick hacks ... this code is so messy it's a
	hassle to hack ... going back to the way it was originally, with
	just a more informative error message instead.

2002-10-09 Wednesday 22:08  moodler

	* lib/ipatlas/plot.inc: 
	
	Changes to avoid cryptic errors

	Initial version

2002-10-07 Monday 02:41  paca70

	* lang/fi/moodle.php: 
	
	Some corrections

2002-10-07 Monday 02:24  paca70

	* lang/fi/quiz.php: 
	
	Initial version

2002-10-07 Monday 01:31  moodler

	* mod/quiz/: category.php, edit.php, question.php: 
	
	Empty file

2002-10-07 Monday 01:20  moodler

	* lib/moodlelib.php: 
	
	New function print_file_picture for printing a picture from the
	files area, or optionally from a URL

2002-10-07 Monday 01:06  moodler

	* mod/quiz/: attempt.php, lib.php, version.php, db/mysql.php,
	db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Further work done.  It currently can print the quiz form (including
	images!) but can't mark them yet.  I've been constructing quizzes
	manually in the database and it's helping to refine the database
	structure.  Don't count on anything stable in the quiz module for a
	few days yet ...

2002-10-06 Sunday 11:24  moodler

	* mod/quiz/attempt.php: 
	
	A start on the page that actually prints the questions and stores
	the answers

2002-10-06 Sunday 11:23  moodler

	* mod/quiz/view.php: 
	
	More or less working now

2002-10-06 Sunday 11:05  moodler

	* course/: social.php, topics.php, weeks.php: 
	
	Changed includes of module libraries to use full pathnames
	constructed from $CFG->dirroot, rather than relative.  This is
	because the relative path could sometime be a different case to the
	full path (on Windows) causing include_once not to work.

2002-10-06 Sunday 01:21  moodler

	* admin/index.php: 
	
	Moved module upgrading functions out into database-specific files

	survey/db/mysql.php: 
	
	Moved upgrade functions into db/mysql.sql

2002-10-06 Sunday 01:09  moodler

	* version.php, admin/index.php, lib/db/mysql.php,
	lib/db/postgres7.php: 
	
	Moved upgrade_moodle functions out to database-specific files,
	because the SQL is not compatible (nor is it possible to make it
	so).

2002-10-06 Sunday 00:49  moodler

	* lib/moodlelib.php: 
	
	create_new_user() can now import other fields from an external
	source if the function for it has been defined.  (Petri's code with
	additions by me)

2002-10-04 Friday 21:07  paca70

	Skeleton version of the quiz module.  It won't break an
	installation, but it doesn't do anything yet.

2002-10-04 Friday 10:55  moodler

	* mod/assignment/mod.html: 
	
	Use main version of "maximum grade" string

2002-10-04 Friday 10:54  moodler

	* auth/ldap/lib.php: 
	
	Corrected some comments.

2002-10-03 Thursday 21:45  paca70

	* auth/ldap/lib.php: 
	
	
	Initial version of ldap authentication module. It have no
	config-interface yet. (But it's coming) It contains also
	experimental auth_get_userinfo() function, what is not used by
	moodle yet.  If you like to try it, create following $CFG variables
	to /config.php or directly to config-table and activate ldap
	authentication from admin-configuration page.
	
	$CFG->ldap_bind_dn		"If your like to use bind-user to
	search users, specify it here. Someting like
	'cn=ldapuser,ou=public,o=org'" $CFG->ldap_bind_pw	 "Password
	for bind-user." $CFG->ldap_contexts		      "List of
	contexts where users are located.				
	Separate different contexts with ';'. Something like
	'ou=users,o=org; ou=other,o=org'"  $CFG->ldap_host_url		
	"Specify LDAP host in URL-form like 'ldap://ldap.myorg.com/' or
	'ldaps//ldap.myorg.com/' "; $CFG->ldap_search_sub	"Put value
	<> 0 if  you like to search users from subcontexts.";
	$CFG->ldap_user_attribute      "What attribute is used to
	name/search users. Usually 'cn'. ";
	
	More configuration optios are coming. This version is tested
	against Novell E-Directory without SSL and it works fine.

2002-10-03 Thursday 19:17  moodler

	between three options:	new discussions and new replies, new
	replies only and no new discussions or new replies.
	
	Three new options in lang/forum.php and I changed
	"allowdiscussions".
