	* mod/resource/: details.php, lib.php, view.php: 
	
	Added new "Program" resource type, which allows Moodle to cooperate
	with external web applications by passing info about the current
	session to them.
	
	Code contributed by Mark Kimes.

	* admin/: forcetables.php, index.php: 
	
	No need for forcetables hack any more.	Moodle can now detect
	whether it has already been installed in the current database (by
	looking for all the main tables) and do the right thing.  It
	doesn't matter now if there are other tables in the database or
	not.

	I've just done all this as carefully as I could ... I don't think I
	missed anything but it's pretty intensive work and I'd be fooling
	myself if I didn't think I'd missed a couple.
	
	Note that this version should pretty much be able to bootstrap
	itself using PostgreSQL now ... but this is untested

	Many many changes lumped in here ... not finished yet either.
	
	Basically all the Database functions are in lib/datalib.php and the
	web functions are all in lib/weblib.php, so moodlelib.php is much
	thinner than it was.
	
	Data functions have been extended ... most old calls will still
	work, but now many more SQL commands can be performed using the
	datalib functions rather than using SQL.  I'm currently moving
	through the whole tree replacing SQL calls or at least
	concentrating them in one section of mod/xxx/lib.php
	
	Still working on forums, quizzes, surveys, resources.
	
	The tree is currently not full working ... some things are
	half-completed ... will resume tomorrow.

2002-10-18 Friday 17:09  moodler

	* lib/weblib.php: 
	
	OK, I've rationalised the text formatting now.	Basically, both
	Moodle and HTML text allow the same range of HTML tags (so it
	doesn't matter is you switch from one to the other).
	
	<IMG> and <A> are now ALLOWED in Moodle text.  However, the
	clean_text function now checks for and removes any embedded
	javascript triggers to avoid cross-site scripting attacks that way.
	
	clean_text() should be called on ANY text that comes in from
	students.

2002-10-18 Friday 17:00  moodler

	* login/signup.php, user/edit.html: 
	
	Default language for users is now the same as the site language.

2002-10-18 Friday 14:05  moodler

	* lib/: languages.php, moodlelib.php, weblib.php: 
	
	Allow <IMG> tags in Moodle format text.  Not having it can really
	mess up smileys etc if the text has been edited at any stage using
	the richtext editor.
	
	I realise it's possible for students to really mess up forums
	display etc if they wanted to include a huge picture ... I'm not
	sure if there are any cross-site scripting attacks possible with
	images in there.
	
	But there is also now the HTML format for most things, which is
	editable using an ordinary form, so this problem is currently
	already exposed.

	***NOTE NOTE NOTE
	**********************************************************
	
	THIS IS A BIG CHANGE!
	
	I've renamed the "reading" module to "resource".
	
	This meant changing quite a few references throughout Moodle.
	
	The automatic upgrade process should work OK (it worked OK on my
	development server) and there shouldn't be any problems.
	
	BUT PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND KEEP BACKUPS OF EVERYTHING
	UNTIL I HAVE A FEW MORE TESTS!	 If you upgrade please let me know.
	
	One thing that will break are any hard-coded links within forum
	messages.
	
	What I will be doing to fix this on my apache server is to add this
	to httpd.conf:
	
	Redirect /mod/reading/ http://moodle.com/mod/resource/
	
	Sorry about any inconvenience, but it's better this is done sooner
	than later.

	Really, it's usable as long as you don't mind using the database

	5.5 and later.
	
	Slightly customised for a slimmer toolbar.

2002-10-09 Wednesday 22:20  moodler

	* lib/ipatlas/plot.inc: 
	
	Arg .. so much for quick hacks ... this code is so messy it's a
	hassle to hack ... going back to the way it was originally, with
	just a more informative error message instead.

2002-10-09 Wednesday 22:08  moodler

	* lib/ipatlas/plot.inc: 
	
	Changes to avoid cryptic errors

2002-10-08 Tuesday 23:51  paca70

	Initial version

2002-10-07 Monday 02:41  paca70

	* lang/fi/moodle.php: 
	
	Some corrections

2002-10-07 Monday 02:24  paca70

	* lang/fi/quiz.php: 
	
	Initial version

2002-10-07 Monday 01:31  moodler

	* mod/quiz/: category.php, edit.php, question.php: 
	
	Empty file

2002-10-07 Monday 01:20  moodler

	* lib/moodlelib.php: 
	
	New function print_file_picture for printing a picture from the
	files area, or optionally from a URL

2002-10-07 Monday 01:06  moodler

	* mod/quiz/: attempt.php, lib.php, version.php, db/mysql.php,
	db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Further work done.  It currently can print the quiz form (including
	images!) but can't mark them yet.  I've been constructing quizzes
	manually in the database and it's helping to refine the database
	structure.  Don't count on anything stable in the quiz module for a
	few days yet ...

2002-10-06 Sunday 11:24  moodler

	* mod/quiz/attempt.php: 
	
	A start on the page that actually prints the questions and stores

	* course/: social.php, topics.php, weeks.php: 
	
	Changed includes of module libraries to use full pathnames
	constructed from $CFG->dirroot, rather than relative.  This is
	because the relative path could sometime be a different case to the
	full path (on Windows) causing include_once not to work.

2002-10-06 Sunday 01:21  moodler

	* admin/index.php: 
	
	Moved module upgrading functions out into database-specific files

	Moved upgrade functions into db/mysql.sql

2002-10-06 Sunday 01:09  moodler

	* version.php, admin/index.php, lib/db/mysql.php,
	lib/db/postgres7.php: 
	
	Moved upgrade_moodle functions out to database-specific files,
	because the SQL is not compatible (nor is it possible to make it
	so).

2002-10-06 Sunday 00:49  moodler

	* lib/moodlelib.php: 
	
	create_new_user() can now import other fields from an external
	source if the function for it has been defined.  (Petri's code with
	additions by me)

2002-10-04 Friday 21:07  paca70

	mod/quiz/lib.php, mod/quiz/mod.html, mod/quiz/version.php,
	mod/quiz/view.php, mod/quiz/db/mysql.sql: 
	
	Skeleton version of the quiz module.  It won't break an
	installation, but it doesn't do anything yet.

2002-10-04 Friday 10:55  moodler

	* mod/assignment/mod.html: 
	
	Use main version of "maximum grade" string

2002-10-04 Friday 10:54  moodler

	* auth/ldap/lib.php: 
	
	Corrected some comments.

2002-10-03 Thursday 21:45  paca70

	* auth/ldap/lib.php: 
	
	
	Initial version of ldap authentication module. It have no
	config-interface yet. (But it's coming) It contains also
	experimental auth_get_userinfo() function, what is not used by
	moodle yet.  If you like to try it, create following $CFG variables
	to /config.php or directly to config-table and activate ldap
	authentication from admin-configuration page.
	
	$CFG->ldap_bind_dn		"If your like to use bind-user to
	search users, specify it here. Someting like
	'cn=ldapuser,ou=public,o=org'" $CFG->ldap_bind_pw	 "Password
	for bind-user." $CFG->ldap_contexts		      "List of
	contexts where users are located.				
	Separate different contexts with ';'. Something like
	'ou=users,o=org; ou=other,o=org'"  $CFG->ldap_host_url		
	"Specify LDAP host in URL-form like 'ldap://ldap.myorg.com/' or
	'ldaps//ldap.myorg.com/' "; $CFG->ldap_search_sub	"Put value
	<> 0 if  you like to search users from subcontexts.";
	$CFG->ldap_user_attribute      "What attribute is used to
	name/search users. Usually 'cn'. ";
	
	More configuration optios are coming. This version is tested
	against Novell E-Directory without SSL and it works fine.

2002-10-03 Thursday 19:17  moodler

	"allowdiscussions".

	First implementation of new authentication system, which can now

	Everything is done through authentication_user_login in

	all.

2002-09-26 Thursday 11:51  martin

	* lib/moodlelib.php: 
	
	Check for USER->email in require_login.  With external

	I added a check for this so now it behaves as you'd expect.

2002-09-08 Sunday 17:47  martin

	Secondly, a new teacher admin tool allows any teacher to modify the
	order and displayed role of teachers in that course.  This affects
	the display on the course listings, the participants page and so

	Added a new administration page that can check the current language

	  Internet Explorer bug that allows sends cookies to different

	smec.moodle.com!!
	
	  Also fixes case where multiple moodle installations may be in
	different
	  directories on the same server.  When you go from one to the
	other the
	  first session will be destroyed now (you can't be logged in the
	two
	  at the same time).  It's just a lot safer this way, for now.
	
	Basically this works by storing the wwwroot variable in the session
	and checking it for every page.

	mod/assignment/version.php: 
	
	Moved uploaded assignment files into a subdirectory called moddata,
	where data from other modules can also live later on.
	
	Also added a README for that directory to warn teachers not to mess
	with it, version code to perform the upgrade, tweaks to
	assignment/lib.php and a tweak to reading module so that assignment
	files aren't listed in the list of possible readings (could get
	messy).

2002-08-28 Wednesday 11:45  martin

	* doc/future.html:

	* CHANGES, config-dist.php, file.php, index.php, files/index.php,
	lib/moodlelib.php, mod/assignment/lib.php: 
	
	Changes to use a new configuration variable: CFG->slasharguments
	
	If true, then display of user pictures or filenames will use the
	method of providing arguments as "slash" arguments - this is much
	better for caching, proxies, search engines etc.  Unfortunately it
	doesn't seem to work on some PHP installations.
	
	If false (the default), then a more compatible method is used (ie
	usual way of passing parameters to scripts)

2002-08-26 Monday 17:28  martin

	* CHANGES: 
	
	Changes

2002-08-07 Wednesday 01:23  martin

	* index.php, admin/user.php, course/enrol.php, course/loginas.php,
	course/mod.php, course/social.php, course/topics.php,
	course/unenrol.php, course/view.php, course/weeks.php,
	doc/install.html, lib/moodlelib.php, lib/setup.php,
	login/change_password.php, login/confirm.php, login/index.php,
	login/logout.php, mod/forum/discuss.php, mod/forum/index.php,
	mod/forum/lib.php, mod/forum/post.php, mod/forum/rate.php,
	mod/forum/search.php, mod/forum/subscribers.php,
	mod/forum/view.php, user/edit.php, user/lib.php: 
	
	
	Widespread changes throughout Moodle to make sure it works on
	servers that have register_globals turned off (this is the default
	setting on newer version of PHP).
	
	In fact it's partly a hack that globalises all GET, POST, FILES AND
	COOKIE variables.  Unfortunately though the SESSION and USER global
	session variables are only available as $_SESSION["USER"] and
	$_SESSION["SESSION"], which is cumbersome to use.
	
	So, for every request I now make a copy of these two session
	variables into $USER and $SESSION.  Whenever I update them
	thoughout Moodle I now have to call save_session("USER") which
	copies them back to the session variable.  This seems to be working
	well now.
	
	Because I'm using $_SESSION etc now this will raise the required
	minimum version of PHP to 4.1.0

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:58  martin

	* config-dist.php: 
	
	Made it a bit clearer.

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:17  martin

	* admin/site.php: 
	
	Close wide-open hacking hole!  This script wasn't checking for
	admin user in the case where the site has been defined already. 
	Oops. Fixed now.

2002-08-06 Tuesday 17:36  martin

	* user/: edit.html, edit.php: 
	
	Can now edit own firstname and lastname, and some tidying

	Whoops ... make sure rated posts still show ratings!  :-)

2002-08-06 Tuesday 14:09  martin

	* mod/forum/lib.php: 
	
	forum_print_discussion now checks to see whether there are any
	ratings that haven't been done yet on a discussion.  If not, then
	it won't print the ratings form.  This avoids a slight confusion
	about the interface that existed previously.

	OK, some massive changes with many files removed or changed.
	
	Basically the changes are:
	
	 - I've merged the 'discuss' module into the forum module
	   which makes the interface MUCH clearer for everyone
	 - I've added a new 'single' forum type that replicates
	   what the old discuss course modules used to look like.
	 - I've got rid of the "discussion" forum type - it will
	   still exist in upgraded courses but as a normal forum.
	 - the 'discuss' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - the 'chat' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - The upgrading system has been improved, and all code
	   is stored in version.php.
	 - I've put in upgrading commands to do the best I can
	   (right now) to upgrade courses that used the discuss
	   module.  It should mostly work, just leaving some
	   "orphan" coursemodules on you course front page.  You
	   can easily delete these using the little 'x'.
	   I may have forgotten something  - I've only tested on
	   my testing server and I'm about to test on my production
	   server to see how it goes.
	 - Forums have a lot of little new features and fixes.	The
	   main one is the subscription process.  Teachers can 'force'
	   subscriptions on any forum.	This disallows everyone from
	   choosing their own mail subscription - it's just on.
	 - The assignment module is half-finished and not working yet
	
	I've still some massive changes to do, mostly involving making all
