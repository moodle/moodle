The Attendance module is supported and maintained by Dan Marsden http://danmarsden.com

The Attendance module was previously developed by
    Dmitry Pupinin, Novosibirsk, Russia,
    Artem Andreev, Taganrog, Russia.

#PURPOSE
The Attendance module allows teachers to maintain a record of attendance, replacing or supplementing a paper-based attendance register.
It is primarily used in blended-learning environments where students are required to attend classes, lectures and tutorials and allows
the teacher to track and optionally provide a grade for the students attendance.

Sessions can be configured to allow students to record their own attendance and a range of different reports are available.
