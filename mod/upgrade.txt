This files describes API changes in /mod/* - activity modules,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.3.6 ===

* There is a new privacy API that every subsystem and plugin has to implement so that the site can become GDPR
  compliant. Activity modules use this API to report what information they store or process regarding users, and provide
  ability to export and delete personal data. See https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Privacy_API for guidelines on how to
  implement the privacy API in your activity module.

=== 3.3 ===

* External functions that were returning file information now return the following additional file fields:
  - mimetype (the file mime type)
  - isexternalfile (if is a file reference to a external repository)
  - repositorytype (the repository name in case is a external file)
  Those fields are VALUE_OPTIONAL for backwards compatibility.
* The block_course_overview has been removed and the related core module *_print_overview functions have been deprecated.
* The block_myoverview has replaced block_course_overview to provide better information to students. To support this,
  actions can now be attached to calendar events. Documentation for the following new API callbacks introduced in
  MDL-55611 can be found at https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Calendar_API. The 3 new callbacks are:
  - mod_<modname>_core_calendar_is_event_visible
  - mod_<modname>_core_calendar_provide_event_action
  - mod_<modname>_core_calendar_event_action_show_items_acount
* Changes to the moodleform_mod class and its usage (MDL-58138):
  - the get_data() method has been overriden. The implementation calls parent::get_data() and a new data_postprocessing() method
  - new data_postprocessing() method added. Mods can override this in their mod_form subclass to modify the submit data. Previously
    mods could only modify submitted data by overriding get_data() in the mod_form subclass. data_postprocessing() is now the way to
    do this correctly.
  - completion: \core_completion\manager calls the overriden mod_x_mod_form->data_postprocessing() to allow mods to modify their
    completion data before saving the bulk completion form. If you've overriden get_data() to modify submit data for completion in
    the past, you should now override the data_postprocessing() method in your mod_form and move your code there, so bulk completion
    editing will be properly supported for your plugin.
=== 3.2 ===

* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* update_module_button() and core_renderer::update_module_button() have been deprecated and should not be used anymore.
  Activity modules should not add the edit module button, the link is already available in the Administration block.
  Themes can choose to display the link in the buttons row consistently for all module types.
* New callback check_updates_since available. Check if the module has any update that affects the current user since the given time.
  Please refer to mod/assign/lib.php, mod/forum/lib.php or mod/quiz/lib.php for sample code.

=== 3.1 ===

* Old /mod/MODULENAME/pix/icon.gif and enrol/paypal/pix/icon.gif GIF icons have been removed. Please use pix_icon
  renderable instead.
* Callback get_types() is deprecated, instead activity modules can define callback get_shortcuts().
  See source code for get_module_metadata().

=== 3.0 ===

* Dropped support for the $module in mod/xxx/version.php files (deprecated
  since 2.7). All activity modules must use the $plugin syntax now. See
  https://docs.moodle.org/dev/version.php for details (MDL-43896).
* Modules using rating component must implement a callback mod_x_rating_can_see_item_ratings(). Refer
  to mod_forum_rating_can_see_item_ratings() for example.

=== 2.9 ===

* Added Grade to pass field to mod_form for activities that support grading.
* The method moodleform_mod::add_intro_editor() used in mod_form.php form
  definitions has been deprecated. Replace it with the new
  moodleform_mod::standard_intro_elements() method that takes the new site
  configuration requiremodintro into account (MDL-49101).

=== 2.8 ===

* Constant FEATURE_GROUPMEMBERSONLY is deprecated. Modules should remove this
  constant from their module_supports() API function.
* $CFG->enablegroupmembersonly no longer exists.

=== 2.7 ===

* modgrade form element has been redesigned and allows setting the maximum grade point higher than 100.
* The usage of $module in mod/xxx/version.php files is now deprecated. Please use
  $plugin instead. The support for the legacy notation will be dropped in Moodle 2.10.
* xxx_get_view_actions() and xxx_get_post_actions() will be ignored by new logging system for
  participation report. view_action and post_action will be detected by event's crud and edulevel.
* The functions xxx_user_outline() and xxx_user_complete() have been removed from the majority of core modules (see MDL-41286),
  except for those that require unique functionality. These functions are used by the outline report, but now if they no longer
  exist, the default behaviour is chosen, which supports the legacy and standard log storages introduced in 2.7 (see MDL-41266).
  It is highly recommended you remove these functions from your module if they are simply performing the default behaviour.

=== 2.6 ===

* Modules using the question bank MUST now declare their use of it with the xxx_supports()
  flag FEATURE_USES_QUESTIONS.
* xxx_get_types() module callback can now return subtypes that have
  a custom help text set. Also instead of array it can now return
  MOD_SUBTYPE_NO_CHILDREN. This is optional and still defaults to prior
  behavior. See get_module_metadata() in course/lib.php for details.
* shift_course_mod_dates() has been modified to accept optional mod instance id. If mod instance id is passed then
  dates changed will happen only on specific module instance and not on all instances of that module in course.

=== 2.5 ===

* support for 'mod/*' filters was removed

=== 2.4 ===

new features:

* mod/xxx/adminlib.php may now include 'plugininfo_yoursubplugintype' class definition
  used by plugin_manager; it is recommended to store extra admin settings classes in this file

* mod_lesson_renderer::header() now accepts an additional parameter $extrapagetitle

* mod/data/lib.php data_get_all_recordids() now has two new optional variables:  $selectdata and $params.

required changes in code:

* define the capability mod/xxx:addinstance (and the corresponding lang string)
  (unless your mod is a MOD_ARCHETYPE_SYSTEM).
* xxx_pluginfile() is now given the 7th parameter (hopefully the last one) that
  contains additional options for the file serving. The array should be re-passed
  to send_stored_file().

* most resourcelib_embed_* functions are replaced with core_media_renderer;
  for an example, see mod/resource/locallib.php, resource_display_embed()

optional - no changes needed:

* add support for handling course drag and drop types - functions
  xxx_dndupload_register() and xxx_dndupload_handle($uploadinfo) see:
  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Implementing_Course_drag_and_drop_upload_support_in_a_module
