This files describes API changes in /mod/* - activity modules,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.8 ===

* Constant FEATURE_GROUPMEMBERSONLY is deprecated. Modules should remove this
  constant from their module_supports() API function.
* $CFG->enablegroupmembersonly no longer exists.

=== 2.7 ===

* modgrade form element has been redesigned and allows setting the maximum grade point higher than 100.
* The usage of $module in mod/xxx/version.php files is now deprecated. Please use
  $plugin instead. The support for the legacy notation will be dropped in Moodle 2.10.
* xxx_get_view_actions() and xxx_get_post_actions() will be ignored by new logging system for
  participation report. view_action and post_action will be detected by event's crud and edulevel.
* The functions xxx_user_outline() and xxx_user_complete() have been removed from the majority of core modules (see MDL-41286),
  except for those that require unique functionality. These functions are used by the outline report, but now if they no longer
  exist, the default behaviour is chosen, which supports the legacy and standard log storages introduced in 2.7 (see MDL-41266).
  It is highly recommended you remove these functions from your module if they are simply performing the default behaviour.

=== 2.6 ===

* Modules using the question bank MUST now declare their use of it with the xxx_supports()
  flag FEATURE_USES_QUESTIONS.
* xxx_get_types() module callback can now return subtypes that have
  a custom help text set. Also instead of array it can now return
  MOD_SUBTYPE_NO_CHILDREN. This is optional and still defaults to prior
  behavior. See get_module_metadata() in course/lib.php for details.
* shift_course_mod_dates() has been modified to accept optional mod instance id. If mod instance id is passed then
  dates changed will happen only on specific module instance and not on all instances of that module in course.

=== 2.5 ===

* support for 'mod/*' filters was removed

=== 2.4 ===

new features:

* mod/xxx/adminlib.php may now include 'plugininfo_yoursubplugintype' class definition
  used by plugin_manager; it is recommended to store extra admin settings classes in this file

optional - no changes needed:

* mod_lesson_renderer::header() now accepts an additional parameter $extrapagetitle

* mod/data/lib.php data_get_all_recordids() now has two new optional variables:  $selectdata and $params.

=== 2.3 ===

required changes in code:

* define the capability mod/xxx:addinstance (and the corresponding lang string)
  (unless your mod is a MOD_ARCHETYPE_SYSTEM).
* xxx_pluginfile() is now given the 7th parameter (hopefully the last one) that
  contains additional options for the file serving. The array should be re-passed
  to send_stored_file().

* most resourcelib_embed_* functions are replaced with core_media_renderer;
  for an example, see mod/resource/locallib.php, resource_display_embed()

optional - no changes needed:

* add support for handling course drag and drop types - functions
  xxx_dndupload_register() and xxx_dndupload_handle($uploadinfo) see:
  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Implementing_Course_drag_and_drop_upload_support_in_a_module
