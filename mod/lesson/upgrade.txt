* The  grade_item_delete function in mod/lesson/lib.php was removed because it was not doing anything and was never called.
* A third optional boolean parameter $endreached was added to lesson::update_timer to indicate that end of lesson was reached. This is used by 'completionendreached' custom completion rule.
* lesson_page_type_endofbranch::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofbranch.php
  and lesson_page_type_endofcluster::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofcluster.php
  have been removed, this is now handled by the base class: lesson_page::update in
  locallib.php and the exact same code is executed (it is also executed by the
  lesson_page_type_cluster class that previously had no update function).
* A fourth parameter (format) has been added to the add_answer() function
  located as part of the lesson_add_page_form_base class. If specified with a value of 'LESSON_ANSWER_HTML'
  then a rich html editor is generated. Otherwise an editor is created with Moodle Auto Format
