Official Chat Module for Moodle
------------------------------

Version 0.2  (for Moodle 1.1)

This module is still very new and very incomplete compared
to what it will be one day.

It's based in part on:

    ARSC: A Really Simple Chat
    by Manuel Kiessling
    http://manuel.kiessling.net/projects/software/arsc/

but I ended up rewriting so much of it there's hardly a line 
of code in use that has not been changed, so perhaps it's 
better to say *inspired* by ARSC.

Things to do yet:

  - fix up the other chat front-end versions 
    (currently only using header_js)

  - make the socket server work

  - postgresql support (db schema)

  - pop-up interface to insert images from URL or uploaded

  - customisable beeps (based on sound in user profile)
   
  - add ability to whisper to someone 

  - GUI setting to turn scrolling on/off
