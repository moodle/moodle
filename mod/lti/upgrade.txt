This files describes API changes in the lti code.

=== 3.0.3 ===

* When requesting a grade from the outcome service, and empty grade will now be returned as
  an empty grade in accordance with the spec. Previously a grade of 0 would be returned.

=== 3.0 ===

* Function lti_view (locallib.php) was renamed to lti_launch_tool.
  A new and different lti_view function was created in the module lib.php containing the code for launching events and update the completion status for the module.


=== 2.8 ===

* Support for LTI 2 added, including extensible services implemented as ltiservice plugins.
* Function sendOAuthBodyPOST removed from OAuthBody.php because it was not being used.
* The field 'grade' in the table {lti} is now an integer rather than a numeric to bring it
  in line with the 'grade' field in other activities.

=== 2.7 ===

* mod_lti\event\unknown_service_api_called now has less data stored in 'other'
  but everything is still available for event observers via method get_message_data()
