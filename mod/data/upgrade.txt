    see in the database (if all the search criterias were removed).
* External function get_entry now returns an additional field "ratinginfo" containing the entry rating information.

=== 3.3.2 ===
* data_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full

* Data field classes extending data_field_base should implement the get_config_for_external method.

    (in the entries section) is no longer displayed for new instances and will be deprecated in a future release
    in favour of the new completion setting.
