    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Quiz" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name        | Test quiz name        |
      | Description | Test quiz description |
    And I add a "True/False" question to the "Test quiz name" quiz with:
      | Question name                      | First question                          |
      | Question text                      | Answer the first question               |
      | General feedback                   | Thank you, this is the general feedback |
      | Correct answer                     | False                                   |
      | Feedback for the response 'True'.  | So you think it is true                 |
      | Feedback for the response 'False'. | So you think it is false                |
    And I log out

    And I follow "Test quiz name"
    And I press "Attempt quiz now"
    Then I should see "Question 1"
    And I should see "Answer the first question"
    And I set the field "True" to "1"
    And I press "Finish attempt ..."
