This files describes API changes in the quiz code.

=== 2.7 ===

* The columns of the quiz_question_instances table have been renamed to match
  the coding guidelines. Specifically
      quiz     -> quizid
      question -> questionid
      grade    -> maxmark


=== 2.6 ===
* As part of improving the page usability and accessibility, we updated the
  heading levels for quiz module so it has a proper nesting. (MDL-41615)

* mod_quiz_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_quiz_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
