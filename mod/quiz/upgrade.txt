This files describes API changes in the quiz code.


=== 2.4.5, 2.5.1 ===

* mod_quiz_renderer::view_best_score should not be used any more. (It did not do
  what the name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_quiz_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
