   Those fields are now marked as VALUE_OPTIONAL for backwards compatibility.

=== 3.1 ===
 * The inteface to forum_get_email_message_id() has changed and no longer needs the $host argument.

=== 3.0 ===
 * External function get_forums_by_courses now returns and additional field "cancreatediscussions" that indicates if the user
   can create discussions in the forum.
 * A new optional parameter (groupid) has been added to get_forum_discussions.
   This parameter can override the automatically calculated current group.
 * New constant FORUM_POSTS_ALL_USER_GROUPS, to be used as parameter in functions where we'd need to retrieve all the user posts.

=== 2.8 ===
 * The following functions have all been marked as deprecated. Many of
   these have not been supported in many releases and should not be relied
   upon:
     forum_count_unrated_posts
     forum_tp_count_discussion_read_records
     forum_get_user_discussions
     forum_tp_count_forum_posts
     forum_tp_count_forum_read_records
     forum_get_open_modes
     forum_get_child_posts
     forum_get_discussion_posts
     forum_get_ratings
     forum_get_tracking_link
     forum_tp_count_discussion_unread_posts
     forum_convert_to_roles
     forum_tp_get_read_records
     forum_tp_get_discussion_read_records
     forum_user_enrolled
     forum_user_can_view_post
 * The following functions have been deprecated and replaced. Please see the phpdoc for each on the new function to use instead:
   * forum_is_subscribed
   * forum_subscribe
   * forum_unsubscribe
   * forum_subscribed_users
   * forum_is_forcesubscribed
   * forum_forcesubscribe
   * forum_get_forcesubscribed
   * forum_get_subscribed_forums
   * forum_get_optional_subscribed_forums
   * forum_get_potential_subscribers
 * External function mod_forum_external::get_forum_discussions has been deprecated.
   Use mod_forum_external::get_forum_discussions_paginated instead.

=== 2.6 ===

* The file post_form.php should not be included, the class it contained has
  been moved so that it can benefit from autoloading.
* The function forum_shorten_post() has been deprecated. It was doing a poor
  job of shortening forum post text and the shorten_text() function does a
  much better job.
* The constant FORUM_TRACKING_ON has been depreciated and replaced by
  FORUM_TRACKING_FORCED. The value between them is maintained, so they are
  interchangeable, but code should migrate to the new name.

=== 2.5 ===

The function forum_check_throttling has been changed so that a warning object is returned when a user has reached the 'Post threshold for warning' or
'Post threshold for blocking' setting, rather than echoing this on screen. This allows the warning to be moved inside the post form as it can be added
as a HTML element, where it is more noticeable. False is returned if there is no need to warn, or restrict the user from posting - see MDL-39182.

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===

* mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get forum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
