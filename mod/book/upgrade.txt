This file describes API changes in the book code.

=== 4.4 ===

* The previously deprecated `book_get_nav_types` method has been removed, along with the `BOOK_LINK_*` constants
* book_get_nav_classes() has been deprecated and won't have replacement because it's not required anymore. It should have been
  deprecated together with book_get_nav_types.

=== 4.0 ===

* book_get_nav_types() has been deprecated. Related settings have been removed. The navigation is now set to only "next" and
 "previous".

=== 3.11 ===
* Final deprecation - booktool_print_get_toc(). Please use render_print_book_toc() instead.

=== 3.8 ===

* The following functions have been finally deprecated and can not be used anymore:
    * book_scale_used()

=== 3.7 ===

* book_export_contents() callback now returns tags information for every chapter.

=== 3.1 ===

* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available
  anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-51580 for more info:
    - mod_book_migrate_moddata_dir_to_legacy()
    - mod_book_migrate_all_areas()
    - mod_book_migrate_area()

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_book_external::get_books_by_courses returned parameter "name" has been changed to PARAM_RAW,
  this is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.

=== 2.7 ===

* bogus legacy log calls were removed
* \mod_book\event\chapter_deleted::set_legacy_logdata() was removed
