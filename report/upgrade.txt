This files describes API changes in /report/* - plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.11 ===

* The new report plugin's can have drop down, which can be included by calling static
  methods save_selected_report and print_report_selector in lib/classes/report_helper.php.
  The save_selected_report helps to remember the most recently accessed report plugin.
  print_report_selector would help to show the dropdown, on the report page. Make sure
  to call print_report_selector after the header is printed/echoed.

=== 3.6 ===

* The final deprecation of xxx_delete_course callback means that this function will no longer be called.
  Please use the observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted instead.

=== 3.2 ===
* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* The report_log_print_graph signature and behaviour has changed to generate charts using
  the new Chart API. The third argument has been renamed to $typeormode and it accepts
  the type (usercourse.png, userday.png) or the mode (today, all).

=== 2.7 ===
* How to migrate reports accessing table 'log':
  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Migrating_log_access_in_reports
* All reports that use logstores must implement a callback report_reportname_supports_logstore($storeinstance) in lib.php of the
  report. Refer MDL-44596 for details.

# add new navigation hooks in lib.php - ex: report_stats_extend_navigation_course(), report_stats_extend_navigation_user()
