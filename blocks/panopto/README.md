# Panopto plugin for Moodle

## What is it?

This is a block for Moodle, that allows courses in Moodle to link directly to Panopto folders, and to display recordings in the sidebar. It also allows for SSO between Moodle and Panopto, and automatically syncs user permissions between both systems.

## Credits

The original Panopto plugin was written by Panopto for Moodle 1.9 and earlier. It has since been rewritten for Moodle 2 by [Spenser Jones](http://spenserjones.com), and subsequently made open-source for collaboration between the open-source community and Panopto.

## How can I help?

Fork the block, fix a bug or add a new feature, and send us a pull-request. Or, if you're not a developer, but you've found a bug, add it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Panopto/Moodle-2.0-Plugin-for-Panopto/issues).
