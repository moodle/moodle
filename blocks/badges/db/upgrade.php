/**
 * This file keeps track of upgrades to the badges block
 *
 * Sometimes, changes between versions involve alterations to database structures
 * and other major things that may break installations.
 *
 * The upgrade function in this file will attempt to perform all the necessary
 * actions to upgrade your older installation to the current version.
 *
 * If there's something it cannot do itself, it will tell you what you need to do.
 *
 * The commands in here will all be database-neutral, using the methods of
 * database_manager class
 *
 * Please do not forget to use upgrade_set_timeout()
 * before any action that may take longer time to finish.
