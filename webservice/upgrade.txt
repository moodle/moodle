This files describes API changes in /webservice/*
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

This information is intended for authors of webservices, not people writing webservice clients.

=== 3.1 ===

* The xmlrpc backend has changed, Zend_XmlRpc has been dropped and there might be slight differences in
  responses. Fault strings that were generated by Zend_XmlRpc_XXX_Exception exceptions (i.e. 'Method
  "[methodname]" does not exist') are no longer used which may display a different error message depending
  on the string returned by the getMessage() method of the thrown exception.
* The xmlrpc server is no longer enabled when the Mobile service is activated.
* Support for the AMF protocol has been dropped completely.
* As Zend Framework has been removed, the webservice_zend_* classes have also been removed.
* Zend_SOAP has been dropped. The native PHP SoapClient and SoapServer classes are now being used instead. WSDL is now
  generated by the new class webservice_soap_wsdl. For fault strings, a different error message might be shown depending
  on the string returned by the getMessage() method of the thrown exception.
* With Zend_SOAP dropped, moodle_zend_soap_server is now also deprecated.
* As mentioned in the 2.9 notes, deprecated web service functions have now been removed.
* Since our new XML-RPC server implementation does not support introspection, it is critical that all clients send
  parameters in the correct order.

=== 3.0 ===

* WS protocols webservice/myprotocol:use capabilities were defined with a high riskbitmask value
  when the fact that a user has that capability does not imply any risk, but other capabilities
  that the user may have do. If your ws protocol does not imply and risk by itself, you can remove the
  riskbitmask from your $capabilities array in webservice/myprotocol/db/access.php
* New function for formatting external strings: external_format_strings, it should be used as a replacement of format_string in
  external functions.
  All the occurrences of format_strings have been replaced with this new function.

=== 2.9 ===

* The deprecated functions can not be added to services anymore and
  a debugging message for developers is triggered when viewing an existing
  services using them. It is recommended to replace calls to the deprecated
  functions for calls to the proposed replacements. If you are using a moodle
  mobile app fork, it is recommended to update your customisations on top of
  the latest moodle mobile app version.

    - moodle_user_update_users
    - core_grade_get_definitions
    - core_user_get_users_by_id
    - moodle_webservice_get_siteinfo

* External function core_webservice_external::get_site_info now returns additional optional fields:
   - advancedfeatures: Array listing Moodle advanced features and if enabled or not.
   - usercanmanageownfiles: Whether the my files option is disabled.
   - userquota: User storage quota.
   - usermaxuploadfilesize: Files upload size limit.


=== 2.7 ===

* All webservice server.php and simpleserver.php scripts must define('WS_SERVER', true)
  before including config.php file.


=== 2.6 ===

* webservice/upload.php
Accepts 2 new post parameters to allow uploading of files to a users draft area.
 - filearea should be either 'private' (default) or 'draft'
 - itemid unused if the filearea is 'private', for 'draft' it can be the id of a previously
   created draft area - or 0 which will generate a new draft area for the files.
