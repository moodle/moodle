            Date:         31st October, 2006
            Version:      2.0
            Status:       CM/DN Release
            Description:  This is a normative representation of the IMS CP 1.2 Information Model for binding 
                          purposes.  Read the corresponding IMS CP Information Model for the Platform 
                          Independent Model representation.

            History:      This is version 1 of the IMS CP v1.2 XSD.  It directly supercedes IMS CP v1.1.4 XSD.
                          Note that the target namespace has NOT been changed.
                          Apart from the functional additions, the main structural changes are:
                          (1) All of the elements and attributes are defined as local to their host object;
                          (2) Comments have been added to the complexType definitions.

                        A file element declares a reference to a single asset.  The reference may
                        be relative to the Package containing the file element or absolute 
                        (external to the Package).
                        
                        A file element may contain child extensions declaring alternative references
                         to the same asset as that referenced by the file element's href attribute.

                        A dependency element provides a way to associate another collection of 
                        asset references within the scope of the dependency element's parent 
                        resource element.
                        
                        This element allows the parsimonious declaration of asset references.  
                        Shared asset references can be declared once and associated many 
                        times through a Dependency element.
