            Version:        1.1
            Status:         Final Release
            Description:    This model forms a part of the IMS GLC Common Catrtridge specification.  This model is the profile of the 
                            IMS GLC Content Package Core specification (v1.2).  The changes made to create the profile are:
                            
                            (a) The 'default' characteristic for the 'Organizations' class has been removed;
                            (b) The 'isvisible' characteristic for the Item class has been removed;
                            (c) The 'parameters' characteristic for the Item class has been removed;
                            (d) The 'structure' characteristic for the Organization class has been fixed to 'rooted-hierarchy';
                            (e) The 'extension' and 'version' characteristics for the Manifest class have been removed;
                            (f) The 'extension' attribute and 'extension' characteristic have been removed the Organizations class;
                            (g) The 'extension' attribute and 'extension' characteristic have been removed the Organization class;
                            (h) The 'extension' attribute and 'extension' characteristic have been removed from the Resources class;
                            (i) The 'extension' attribute and the 'extension' characteristic have been removed from the Resource class;
                            (j) The 'extension' attribute and 'extension' characteristic have been removed from the Item class;
                            (k) The 'extension' attribute and the 'extension' characteristic have been removed from the File class;
                            (l) The 'extension' attribute and 'extension' characteristic have been removed from the Dependency class;
                            (m) The 'type' characteristic of the Resource class has a new enumerated list of 'PredfinedContentTypes';
                            (n) The 'title' attribute for the Item class has its multiplicity changed to '1' except for the top-level item 
                            attribute in the Orgaization class where it must not occur;
                            (o) Manifests are NO longer allowed to contain sub-manifests;
                            (p) The multiplicity of the Organization class in the Organizations class has been made '0..1';
                            (q) Only the metadata in the Manifest class is permitted to have the 'schema' and 'schemaversion' attributes;
                            (r) The 'schema', 'schemaversion' and 'title' attributes are redefined directly as 'String' primitiveTypes;
                            (s) The multiplicity of the 'item' attribute in the Organization class has been made '1';
                            (t) The value for the 'schema' attribute has been set as 'IMS Common Cartridge';
                            (u) The value for the 'schemaversion' attribute has been set to '1.1.0';
                            (v) The authorizations attribute has been added as an imported extension to the manifest;
                            (w) The protect attribute has been added as an imported extension to the resource;
                            (x) The IEEE LOM attribute has been added as an imported extension to the manifest metadata;
                            (y) The 'intendeduse' attribute has been added to the ResourceType complexType.

            History:        This profile is taken from the formal representation in UML of the IMS CP v1.2 core specification.
                            This is the second version of the profile for the CCv1.1.  The two changes are the addition of the 
                            ResourceMetadata class and the vocabulary for the permitted resource types.
