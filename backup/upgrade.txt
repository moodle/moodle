This files describes API changes in /backup/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.6 ===

* The backup_controller_dbops::create_temptable_from_real_table()
  method is not available anymore. Temp tables must be created
  inline always.

* Using the info field from backup_ids_temp or backup_files_temp
  must now go via backup_controller_dbops::decode_backup_temp_info() and
  backup_controller_dbops::encode_backup_temp_info(). The implementation
  of the encoding has changed.  These new functions encapsulate any future
  changes to the encoding.

=== 2.5 ===

* New optional param $sortby in backup set_source_table() allows to
    specify the ORDER BY clause to be used. Previously it was required
    to use the set_source_sql() more complex alternative in places
    requiring ordering.
* The old 1.9 files backuplib.php, lib.php and restorelib.php and the bb directory,
    (all under /backup) have been deleted and no code should rely on them anymore.

=== 2.4 ===

* Since 2.3.1+ the backup file name schema has changed. The ID of the course will always be part of
    the filename regardless of the setting 'backup_shortname'. See MDL-33812.

* Since 2.3.1+ the backup file name schema has changed. The ID of the course will always be part of
