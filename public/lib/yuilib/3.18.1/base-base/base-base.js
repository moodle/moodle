     * <p>
     * A base class which objects requiring attributes and custom event support can
     * extend. Base also handles the chaining of initializer and destructor methods across
     * the hierarchy as part of object construction and destruction. Additionally, attributes configured
     * through the static <a href="#property_ATTRS">ATTRS</a> property for each class
     * in the hierarchy will be initialized by Base.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * **NOTE:** Prior to version 3.11.0, ATTRS would get added a class at a time. That is,
     * Base would loop through each class in the hierarchy, and add the class' ATTRS, and
     * then call it's initializer, and move on to the subclass' ATTRS and initializer. As of
     * 3.11.0, ATTRS from all classes in the hierarchy are added in one `addAttrs` call before
     * any initializers are called. This fixes subtle edge-case issues with subclass ATTRS overriding
     * superclass `setter`, `getter` or `valueFn` definitions and being unable to get/set attributes
     * defined by the subclass. This order of operation change may impact `setter`, `getter` or `valueFn`
     * code which expects a superclass' initializer to have run. This is expected to be rare, but to support
     * it, Base supports a `_preAddAttrs()`, method hook (same signature as `addAttrs`). Components can
     * implement this method on their prototype for edge cases which do require finer control over
     * the order in which attributes are added (see widget-htmlparser).
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The static <a href="#property_NAME">NAME</a> property of each class extending
     * from Base will be used as the identifier for the class, and is used by Base to prefix
     * all events fired by instances of that class.
