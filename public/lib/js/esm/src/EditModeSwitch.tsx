 * the existing core/edit_switch AMD module: this only takes over calling its init() once mounted,
 * exactly as the old mustache {{#js}} block used to do server-side. The ajax call reads its session
 * key from M.cfg.sesskey, not from a form field, so no sesskey prop is passed here; the enclosing
 * form's own hidden `sesskey` field is only there for the NonJS fallback's plain POST submission.
 *
 * The markup below (and the NonJS fallback in editswitch.mustache) is hand-mirrored from the
 * design system's own Switch DOM/classes rather than generated from it. If the design system
 * Switch component's markup or classes change, both this component and the mustache fallback
 * need to be updated to match.
