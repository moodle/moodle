  /**
   * Retrieves the list of all BackendService resources, regional and global,
   * available to the specified project.
   *
   * To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the `returnPartialSuccess`
   * parameter to `true`. (backendServices.aggregatedList)
   *
   * @param string $project Name of the project scoping this request.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in
   * the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
   * expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API
   * improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be
   * mixed in one request.
   *
   * If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
   * operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be
   * a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`,
   * `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.
   *
   * For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude
   * instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.
   *
   * The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For
   * example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ```
   *
   * You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
   * `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are
   * not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields
   * to filter based onresource labels.
   *
   * To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
   * parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
   * (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND`
   * expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
   * For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel
   * Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
   *
   * If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not
   * equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without
   * quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:
   *
   * `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
   * `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2
   * ne "literal")`
   *
   * The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2
   * library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
   *
   * For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
   * you would use `name ne .*instance`.
   *
   * You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
   * @opt_param bool includeAllScopes Indicates whether every visible scope for
   * each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response.
   * For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
   * resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in
   * response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is
   * omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is
   * expected to be found will be included.
   * @opt_param string maxResults The maximum number of results per page that
   * should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than
   * `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to
   * get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values
   * are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
   * @opt_param string orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default,
   * results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
   *
   * You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
   * using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the
   * `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result
   * first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
   * operation is returned first.
   *
   * Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to
   * the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
   * of results.
   * @opt_param bool returnPartialSuccess Opt-in for partial success behavior
   * which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is
   * false.
   *
   * For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
   * single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
   * with an error code.
   * @opt_param string serviceProjectNumber The Shared VPC service project id or
   * service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for
   * subnetworks list-usable api.
