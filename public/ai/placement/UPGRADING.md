# aiplacement (plugin type) Upgrade notes

## 5.2dev

### Added

- A new page-level property has been added to moodle_page to indicate whether AI-related UI elements are preferred to be shown on a given page. This value acts as an advisory hint only. It does not enforce the visibility of AI-related UI elements globally.
