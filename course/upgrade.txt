=== 3.10 ===

* The function make_categories_options() has now been deprecated. Please use \core_course_category::make_categories_list() instead.

  for each custom course field, which contains the original/unformatted version of the custom field value.

=== 3.9 ===

* The function get_module_metadata is now deprecated. Please use \core_course\local\service\content_item_service instead.
* Activity module names are now PARAM_ALPHANUM instead of PARAM_ALPHA so integers can be used in activity module names

  without hidden courses.

=== 3.7 ===

 * The course pattern function in course_summary_exporter::get_course_pattern has been moved to $OUTPUT->get_generated_image_for_id.

=== 3.5 ===

 * There is a new capability 'moodle/course:setforcedlanguage' to control which users can force the course
   language; create_course and update_course functions delegate access control to the caller code; if you
   are calling those functions you may be interested in checking if the logged in user has 'moodle/course:setforcedlanguage' capability.

 * The modchooser now uses a renderable and a template, thus its associated renderer
   methods have been deprecated. Note that the call to core_course_render::course_modchooser,
   is still required. Deprecated methods:
   - core_course_renderer::course_modchooser_module_types
   - core_course_renderer::course_modchooser_module
   - core_course_renderer::course_modchooser_title

   external functions. core_course_external::get_courses external function is now returning courses end date values.
