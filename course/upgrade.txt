=== 3.9 ===

* The function get_module_metadata is now deprecated. Please use \core_course\local\service\content_item_service instead.
* Activity module names are now PARAM_ALPHANUM instead of PARAM_ALPHA so integers can be used in activity module names

 * There is a new capability 'moodle/course:setforcedlanguage' to control which users can force the course
