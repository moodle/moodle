This files describes API changes in /course/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.4 ===
* New behat steps backported to stable versions:
  - I add a :activityname to section :sectionnum using the activity chooser
  - I add a :activitypluginname activity to course :coursefullname section :sectionnum
  - I add a :activitypluginname activity to course :coursefullname section :sectionnum and I fill the form with:
* set_coursemodule_visible() has a new $rebuildcache parameter. If this is being called multiple times in the same request,
  consider passing `false` for this parameter and rebuilding the cache once after all the course modules have been updated.
  See course_update_section() for an example.

=== 4.3 ===
* The `core_course_renderer::course_section_cm_completion` method has been removed, and can no longer be used
* External function core_course_external::get_course_contents() now returns a new field activitybadge with the data to display
  the activity badge when the module implements it.
* prepare_new_moduleinfo_data() now accepts a parameter "suffix" that will be added to the name of the completion rules.
* The method core_course_bulk_activity_completion_renderer:: edit_default_completion() has been deprecated and will be removed.
* The `core_course\output\activity_information` output class has been deprecated. Use `core_course\output\activity_completion`
  and `core_course\output\activity_dates` instead.
  Alongside with that, the following methods have been deprecated too:
  - `core_course_renderer::render_activity_information()`
  - `renderer_base::activity_information()`

=== 4.2 ===
* course/mod.php now accepts parameter beforemod for adding course modules. It contains the course module id
  of an existing course module. The new module is inserted before this module.
* The function duplicate_module() now has two new optional parameters:
  - $sectionid to specify section the duplicated course module is placed in
  - $changename to disable changing the name of the course module using the 'duplicatedmodule' lang string
* The method `make_categories_options`, deprecated since 3.10, has been removed
* External function core_course_external::get_courses_by_field and core_course_external::search_courses now return a field
called "courseimage" containing a URL pointing to the course image.
* External function core_course_external::get_course_contents() does not throw exceptions for invalid course formats anymore.

=== 4.1 ===
* The function course_modchooser() has been finally deprecated and can not be used anymore. Please use
  course_activitychooser() instead.
* A critical accessibility issue is been found (MDL-74800) at the output class
  core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm\cmname. To solve the problem this output element is not
  rendered anymore using inplace_editable but using a regular named_templatable interface.
  Some format plugins that override the deprecated renderer method course_section_cm_name can be affected.
  Check the current course_section_cm_name code to see how to render it properly.

=== 4.0 ===
* All activity icons have been replaced with black monochrome icons. The background
colour for these icons is defined using a new 'FEATURE_MOD_PURPOSE' support variable in the module lib.php file
Available purpose types are:
  - MOD_PURPOSE_COMMUNICATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_ASSESSMENT
  - MOD_PURPOSE_COLLABORATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_CONTENT
  - MOD_PURPOSE_ADMINISTRATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_INTERFACE
  - MOD_PURPOSE_OTHER
The colours for these types are defined in theme/boost/scss/moodle/variables.scss
* The format_base is now deprecated. Use core_courseformat\base instead.
* The new course output components deprecate many renderer methods from course
renderer and course format renderer:
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content: to render the general course structure
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\section: to render a section
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm: to render an activity card inside a section
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm\*: to render parts of the course structure
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\section\*: to render parts of the course section
* The previous format renderer page_title method has been moved to course_format::page_title
* New format renderer methods to interact with the new output components:
  - render: override the default templatable mustache location for the new course components.
  - course_section_updated_cm_item: used when the course editor needs to update a cm item HTML.
  - render_content: contrib formats should override this method to change the default template.

* Class core_course\output\course_module_name is deprecated. Now core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm\cmname controls inline edit.

  - course_get_user_navigation_options
  - core_course_externalcore_course_external::get_user_navigation_options
* New external \core_course\external\get_enrolled_courses_with_action_events_by_timeline_classification:
  - Returns courses the user is enrolled in which contain at least one action event in the supplied time/text filtering parameters.

    action events.
* The following functions have been deprecated in favour the tertiary navigation constructs:
  - management_heading
  - course_search_form
  - print_course_request_buttons
* New page_setup() method in the core_course_category class. This method can be used for a general page setup in the course

=== 3.11 ===
* A new callback xxx_coursemodule_definition_after_data that allows plugins to extend activity forms after the data is set.
* \core_course_renderer::course_section_cm_completion() has been deprecated. It is not being used anymore and is being replaced by
  \core_renderer::activity_information().
* New Behat steps for checking activity date information in the \behat_course class:
  - activity_date_in_activity_should_contain_text()

 * The course pattern function in course_summary_exporter::get_course_pattern has been moved to $OUTPUT->get_generated_image_for_id.

 * There is a new capability 'moodle/course:setforcedlanguage' to control which users can force the course
   language; create_course and update_course functions delegate access control to the caller code; if you
