## What is Rubrics?
View your assignments’ complete rubric results for all your course students in one report. 

This gives a tabular, downloadable, and precise breakdown of ALL of the individual rubric criteria, with the students’ marks, feedback, final grade, and final overall feedback.​

This supports standardised grading by providing an overview of all grades and students in one report.
