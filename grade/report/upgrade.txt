This files describes API changes in /grade/report/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.3 ===
* The load_users() method in the gradereport_singleview\local\screen class has been deprecated. Please use
  grade_report::get_gradable_users() instead.
* The \gradereport_singleview\local\screen\select has been deprecated. This class generates the output for the initial
  view to select the single view item type (user or grade item) which is no longer actively used as we do not provide
  direct links to it.
* The following reports now use the combobox search PHP & JS rather than defining their own:
  - gradereport_grader
  - gradereport_singleview
  - gradereport_user
  Each of these reports extend the base user, grade or group JS class in either core or core_grades so that they can define how their clickable links are generated.
  Any special handling of the search dropdowns should be done in the JS class "closest" to your plugin rather than in core_grades or the base search class itself.

=== 4.2 ===
* 'Show calculations' setting has been removed from grader report (link is moved to grade action menu)
* 'Show activity icons' setting has been removed from grader report
* The grade_report_grader:get_icons(), grade_report_grader:get_left_icons_row()
  and grade_report_grader:get_right_icons_row() functions have been deprecated and are not used anymore.
* 'Show grade analysis icon' setting has been removed from grader report (link is moved to grade action menu)
* 'Show locks' setting has been removed from grader report (link is moved to grade action menu)
* 'Show show/hide icons' setting has been removed from grader report (link is moved to grade action menu)
* 'Enable AJAX' interface has been deprecated for grader report

* A new method grade_report::get_additional_context() is created to obtain links to other grade plugins report pages.
 It loops through all installed grade report plugins and checks if callback function gradereport_*_get_report_link
 is implemented in for given grade report plugin in the corresponding lib.php
* The setting $CFG->grade_report_studentsperpage has been completely removed because it's not required anymore. This setting
  was used to set the default number of students displayed per page in the grader report. Now the default is set to
  20.
* The get_grade_item_id() function in behat_gradereport_grader.php has been deprecated. Please use
  behat_grades::get_grade_item_id() instead.
* The grade_report::get_lang_string() has been deprecated. Please use get_string() instead.

=== 3.6 ===
* External function gradereport_user_external::get_grade_items now return the following information (only for course managers).
  - locked: Whether the grade item is locked.
  - gradeislocked: Whether the user grade is locked.
  - gradeisoverridden: Whether the user grade is overridden.

=== 3.2 ===
* External function gradereport_user_external::get_grades_table now has an optional groupid parameter.
Is recommended to use this parameter in courses with separate groups or when the user requesting the report is in more than one group.

=== 2.9 ===
* Deprecating grade_report_grader:get_collapsing_icon.
* A new web service function gradereport_user_get_grades_table has been added which will allow external system to retrieve grade information ready to be formatted as a table similar to the gradebook user report one.

=== 2.8.2 ===
* gradereport_singleview::__construct doesn't need groupid parameter anymore, so it was renamed to $unused.

=== 2.6.5, 2.7.2 ===

* The callback function grade_report_*_profilereport now takes one more parameter $viewasuser. This parameter
  is set to true when the report must be viewed as the user whose grades are being displayed. For instance,
  when a mentor/parent is viewing the report, they should see the same grades, not more, not less. When the
  setting is set to false (default), the capability checks, visibility and access levels are using the
  currently logged in user.

=== 2.6 ===
* grade_report_grader::get_toggles_html() and grade_report_grader::print_toggle()
  can not be used any more
* class grade_report get_numusers($groups = true, $users = false)

The array keys are course IDs while the array values are the value of the course setting "report_overview_showtotalsifcontainhidden".
