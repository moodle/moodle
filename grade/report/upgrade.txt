This files describes API changes in /grade/report/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.8.2 ===
* gradereport_singleview::__construct doesn't need groupid parameter anymore, so it was renamed to $unused.

=== 2.6.5, 2.7.2 ===

* The callback function grade_report_*_profilereport now takes one more parameter $viewasuser. This parameter
  is set to true when the report must be viewed as the user whose grades are being displayed. For instance,
  when a mentor/parent is viewing the report, they should see the same grades, not more, not less. When the
  setting is set to false (default), the capability checks, visibility and access levels are using the
  currently logged in user.

=== 2.6 ===
* grade_report_grader::get_toggles_html() and grade_report_grader::print_toggle()
  can not be used any more
* class grade_report get_numusers($groups = true, $users = false)
  An extra parameter has been added to restrict count to those users being
displayed
* class grade_report_grader get_left_rows($displayaverages)
  A parameter has been added to indicate whether averages are applicable and
should be displayed on the report
* class grade_report_grader get_right_rows($displayaverages)
  A parameter has been added to indicate whether averages are applicable and
should be displayed on the report
* class grade_report_grader get_grade_table($displayaverages = false)
  A parameter has been added to indicate whether averages are applicable and
should be displayed on the report

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===
* class_grade_report::showtotalsifcontainhidden has been switched from a single integer value to an array.
The array keys are course IDs while the array values are the value of the course setting "report_overview_showtotalsifcontainhidden".
