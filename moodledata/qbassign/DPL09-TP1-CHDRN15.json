	"question": "An object dropped in Earth's gravitational field undergoes uniform accelerated motion. Below are the equations of motion for an object in uniformly accelerated motion:<br> <img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DPL09U1S03Image3.png' width='80%' height='25%'><br> (where 𝑠 = distance traveled; 𝑢 = initial velocity; 𝑣 = final velocity; 𝑎 = acceleration; 𝑡 = time of motion)<br> Write a program to solve the following:<br>● Using a suitable equation from above, calculate the object's final velocity if it is in free fall for 3 seconds. Consider the value of acceleration due to gravity= 9.8 m/s. (Hint: As the object is in free fall, its initial velocity is zero.)<br>● Calculate the distance covered by the object in 3 seconds using the 𝑠 = 𝑢𝑡 + 12 𝑎𝑡2 equation.<br>● Calculate the distance covered by the object in free fall at 1, 2, and 5 seconds.",
