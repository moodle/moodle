* \core_analytics\regressor::evaluate_regression and \core_analytics\classifier::evaluate_classification
  have been updated to include a new $trainedmodeldir param. This new param will be used to evaluate the
  existing trained model.

* There are two new methods for analysers, processes_user_data() and join_sample_user(). You
  need to overwrite them if your analyser uses user data. As a general statement, you should
  overwrite these new methods if your samples return 'user' data. These new methods are used
  for analytics' privacy API implementation.
