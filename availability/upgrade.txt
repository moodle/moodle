This files describes API changes in /availability/*.

The information here is intended only for developers.

=== 2.8 ===

* There is a new API function in the info_module/info_section objects (and
  related functions in internal API): get_user_list_sql. This returns SQL code
  that does roughly the same as filter_user_list to return a list of users who
  should be shown as having access to the module or section.

* Any third-party availability plugins which return true to
  is_applied_to_user_lists (and therefore previously implemented
  filter_user_list) should now also implement get_user_list_sql. If not
  implemented, a debugging warning will occur when anybody calls
  get_user_list_sql if the affected plugin is in use, and that user list will
  not be filtered by the plugin.
